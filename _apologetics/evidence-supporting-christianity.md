## Intro
Most atheists or deniers of Christianity will say things like, "*There's no evidence supporting Christianity*." Unfortunately, Christians tend to answer these claims thoughtlessly and say things like, "*Well, I have faith it's true*." Commendable, but irresponsible. Obviously, this is not the answer any questioner of religion would be willing to accept, and let's face it, you can't really blame them. So, let's examine this claim with a little more substance in defense of Christianity by supporting with... you guessed it... evidence!

## Evidence
### Historical
Those that deny the Bible claim that it is simply a myth and is a book created from the minds of men several hundred years ago without any supporting historical evidence. The problem with this theory is that there is too much historical evidence discrediting this claim. Between chronological dating of the New Testament manuscripts found in various places throughout the Mediterranean [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://library.duke.edu/papyrus/texts/manuscripts.html#:~:text=Thousands%20more%20ancient%20Greek%20manuscripts,yielded%20most%20of%20the%20manuscripts) or other surrounding areas, to non-Christian references mentioning the person of Jesus (or Christianity) to in fact have existed, there are numerous ancient writings verifying and corroborating the evidence in support of Christianity.

**Extrabiblical References**<br>
One of the earliest non-Christian references to Jesus is thought to have been made from Josephus in his "*Jewish Antiquities*" book about historical Judaism written in 93 AD [<sup>[2]</sup>](https://bigthink.com/thinking/was-jesus-real). Earlier than this, many biblical books are widely accepted to have been written between 44-49 AD [<sup>[3]</sup>](http://faithgateway.com/products/chronological-aspects-of-the-life-of-christ?variant=33622878060680&utm_source=bg&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=bookpromo) (the range for all New Testament books is much greater, these are just the earliest known books). This means, roughly 11-16 years after Jesus was crucified [<sup>[4]</sup>](https://cbs.mbts.edu/2020/04/08/april-3-ad-33-why-we-believe-we-can-know-the-exact-date-jesus-died/#:~:text=We%20conclude%20that%20Jesus%20was,firmly%20anchored%20in%20human%20history) we have the first letters detailing His life and giving an account of His death by crucifixion and, three days later, His resurrection. 

Some would argue against the above that Josephus may have not been the earliest non-Christian reference to Jesus and Christianity. Though this may be true to an extent, since **Thallus** is often regarded to have been the first non-Christian writer (~52 AD). However, most, if not all of Thallus' writings no longer exist. Though this may be the case, **Julius Africanus** in 221 AD quoted Thallus' writings which stated [<sup>[5]</sup>](https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/is-there-any-evidence-for-jesus-outside-the-bible/): 

> "*On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.*" (Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1)

This is directly in support of the accounts mentioned in the Bible of a large earthquake and darkness across the land after Christ's crucifixion. Actually, this is even how geologists have pinpointed Jesus' death to have occurred in 33 AD due to tracing the seismic activity to that time period [<sup>[6]</sup>](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna47555983).

Another example of ancient writings from non-Christian sources can be that of **Tacitus**, who was a Roman historian known for hating Christians. Tacitus wrote this speaking about Christ and Christianity in 116-117 AD [<sup>[7]</sup>](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/):

> "*Neither human effort nor the emperor’s generosity nor the placating of the gods ended the scandalous belief that the fire had been ordered [by Nero]. Therefore, to put down the rumor, Nero substituted as culprits and punished in the most unusual ways those hated for their shameful acts … whom the crowd called “Chrestians.” The founder of this name, Christ [Christus in Latin], had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate … Suppressed for a time, the deadly superstition erupted again not only in Judea, the origin of this evil, but also in the city [Rome], where all things horrible and shameful from everywhere come together and become popular.*"

**Lucian** is yet another reference to have mentioned Christianity much after Christ's death on the Cross. This statement by Lucian coming around 130-135 AD [<sup>[7]</sup>](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/):

> "*It was then that he learned the marvelous wisdom of the Christians, by associating with their priests and scribes in Palestine. And—what else?—in short order he made them look like children, for he was a prophet, cult leader, head of the congregation and everything, all by himself. He interpreted and explained some of their books and wrote many himself. They revered him as a god, used him as a lawgiver, and set him down as a protector—to be sure, after that other whom they still worship, the man who was crucified in Palestine because he introduced this new cult into the world.
> For having convinced themselves that they are going to be immortal and live forever, the poor wretches despise death and most even willingly give themselves up. Furthermore, their first lawgiver persuaded them that they are all brothers of one another after they have transgressed once for all by denying the Greek gods and by worshiping that crucified sophist himself and living according to his laws.*"

**The Gospel Itself!**<br>
Maybe most fascinating (at least it was to me), the earliest known evidence supporting Christianity, believe it or not, is the Gospel itself found through a creedal manuscript [<sup>[8]</sup>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/earliest-evidence-christianity/)! This manuscript was dated to be around 35-38 AD, just a few short years after Christ's crucifixion (~33 AD). Maybe the most compelling aspect of this finding is that it was not associated with any prior writings or letters at that time... yet. Paul later added almost the exact wording found in the creedal manuscript to 1st Corinthians 15:3-8 which is believed to have been written between 52-55 AD.

According to 1st Corinthians 15:1-4, the Gospel simply explains the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Why is this important? Paul mentions that the Gospel is something that "*ye have received*" and "*that which I also received*." Many scholars believe this to mean that there was evidence of people spreading this news rapidly throughout that time period just after Christ was crucified. Enter the creedal manuscript. The finding of this manuscript was a massive archaeological discovery supporting Christianity since, not only did it contain the Gospel (verses 3-4 of 1st Corinthians chapter 15), but it accounted for the eyewitness reports for those that saw Christ after His resurrection (verses 5-8 of 1st Corinthians chapter 15). In addition to this, the manuscript was not part of the Bible at the time it was written--meaning this finding was outside of any Biblical scrolls or other letters/epistles at that time. Since the Gospel is *precisely* how we are saved if we simply believe it and trust in Jesus Christ, we must then ask the question, "*Is this a mere coincidence that the Gospel is the earliest known support for Christianity?*" Maybe, though I find this hard to believe. If God truly does exist, what better piece of evidence could have ever *possibly* been found? In any case, one cannot deny that it is rather compelling how this text was preserved for so long, found to have been written **just** after Jesus was crucified, and found to be the earliest evidence in support of Christianity.

**Eyewitness Reports**<br>
One of the greatest pieces of evidence proving a claim is that of an eyewitness report. From the earlier reference of the found creedal manuscript in support of Christianity, this was directly what 1st Corinthians 15:5-8 mentions. There were over 500 eyewitness reports claiming to have seen Jesus. Most interesting, these were **all** after His resurrection. But "*you can't just use the Bible, bro*", right? Well, though 1st Corinthians 15 was directly referencing this manuscript, the creedal manuscript was likely written much before. Even highly educated atheist scholars such as Gerd Ludeman said [<sup>[8]</sup>](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/earliest-evidence-christianity/):

> "*[this manuscript is] one of the great achievements of recent New Testament scholarship*"

Regardless of faith, or lack thereof, New Testament scholars agree that these claims of eyewitness reports seeing Jesus after His resurrection are undeniable forms of historical evidence.  


### Archaeological
**Beit Loya**<br>
Some of the most compelling evidence in support of Jesus' life and death comes by way of archaeological evidence. One such finding can be seen in this video.

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cH6BJDxQjAU" ratio="16:9" %}

If you're lazy like me and need a **TL;DR**, you're in luck and I'll sum it up for you. 

An ancient archaeological site called Beit Loya was found around the year 1899 [<sup>[9]</sup>](https://www.israel21c.org/secrets-of-a-lost-village-of-ancient-israel-come-to-light/). This site has many caves and in a small and seemingly insignificant cave, a massive archaeological discovery was made. Thought to be one of the oldest inscriptions mentioning Jesus was written in Greek and translated as "Jesus Present" in this cave. This inscription was dated to be in the late-100s to early-200s AD. This timeframe also explains why this inscription was written in a cave because this was around the time period of intense Roman persecution to Christians. Therefore, most Christians were forced in hiding to praise and worship Jesus in underground caves throughout the surrounding areas.

**The Dead Sea Scrolls**<br>
It's nearly impossible *not* to mention the Dead Sea Scrolls when speaking of archaeological evidence in support of Christianity. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947 in a cave on the western side of the Dead Sea (it's a shocker that they named them "Dead Sea Scrolls" right?). These scrolls contained 190 biblical scrolls and even an entire scroll of the book of Isaiah [<sup>[10]</sup>](https://www.crossway.org/articles/10-crucial-archaeological-discoveries-related-to-the-bible/). Of the over 800 fragments in total that were found in these scrolls, every **single** Old Testament book was found except the book of Esther [<sup>[11]</sup>](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-wrote-the-dead-sea-scrolls-11781900/), which further confirmed the Hebrew canon was correct that had been in use for hundreds of years before this discovery was made. 

**Not Just Biblical Characters**<br>
The beauty of archaeology is that it confirms, sometimes indirectly, alternative evidence through inscriptions and other findings. One such way this method supports Christianity is by way of biblical characters being confirmed as real people and to have existed. A largely used claim to invalidate Christianity by atheists or agnostics is King David. They claim there is no supporting evidence *anywhere* outside of the Bible that a King named David existed throughout history. Now, this may have been true decades ago, but a recent discovery in 1993--just 3 short decades ago as of this writing--found undeniable evidence of King David's existence and reign as King through the famous Tel Dan inscription [<sup>[12]</sup>](https://www.baslibrary.org/biblical-archaeology-review/40/2/4). In fact, through many of these inscriptions (Tel Dan and many others), over 50 people mentioned in the Bible have been confirmed through extra-Biblical sources! 

## Conclusion
The claim that *there's no evidence supporting Christianity* is one lacking any real substance. Maybe the question we should ask atheists and agnostics who present this claim to us is, "*Where is your evidence for that?*" As you can see, there are **many** forms of evidence supporting Jesus Christ, and in turn, Christianity. From letters and epistles to eyewitness reports, these evidences cannot be denied or disproved. A rather interesting piece of evidence, darkness in the land and a large earthquake directly after Christ was crucified even can be supported! No longer can this be called a mythical or fantasy story in the Bible. Geologists have traced back seismic activity to confirm a very large earthquake happened around the time of Jesus' crucifixion (~33 AD). In addition to the various historical evidence, archaeological evidences present sometimes even more intriguing forms of support to Christianity. One such finding through archaeology was that of an ancient site, Beit Loya. This was known to have been possibly the earliest inscription found mentioning Jesus and was found in a cave during the time period of intense Christian persecution (late-100s to early-200s AD). Regardless of the type of evidence, it is fascinating how much is out there in support of Jesus--so much so that I am upset I can't put it all into one post.

## TL;DR
The genealogies differ since Matthew focuses on the Lord Jesus's earthly father (Joseph), while Luke focuses on His mother (Mary). This also explains why Joseph's father is different (Matthew 1:16 - Jacob | Luke 3:23 - Heli) between the two Gospels. Since two genealogies are being traced, the genealogy in Matthew, though tracing Jesus's lineage through Joseph, still utilizes the feminine verb form in the Greek which points to Him being Mary's son and not Joseph's physical son. The reason for this is because Joseph's lineage could not hold the throne since he descended from Jeconiah (Jeremiah 22:30), thus pointing to another reason for a virgin birth, since a husband--upon marriage--could become the son of his father-in-law and carry the family name of the woman according to Mosaic Law. Therefore, there's no issue with Joseph legally being the son of Heli, Mary's earthly father due to a [Levirate Marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage#:~:text=Levirate%20marriage%20is%20a%20type,outside%20the%20clan%20is%20forbidden.).

## Contradiction?
### Matthew's Genealogy
Let's first understand one thing before we dive into the "contradiction": Matthew was very likely a Jew who was writing to Jews. Not only does church tradition hold this, but this is also seen in how Matthew writes. For example: Matthew traces the Lord Jesus's lineage back to Abraham--the father of Jacob (Israel). This emphasizes the Lord Jesus's Jewish heritage, which will be important in just a moment. 

Another reason Matthew was likely a Jew was because he consistently cites fulfillment of prophecies through the Lord, some examples include:

* Matthew 1:21-23
* Matthew 2:15,17-18
* Matthew 4:14-16
* etc.

Lastly, Matthew mentions Jewish customs and laws without further expansion or explanation, which points to his readers likely understanding his references (example: Matthew 15:2, Matthew 23:5, etc.)

This is important because Matthew 1:11 mentions Jeconiah in Joseph's lineage; however, because of Jeconiah's actions, he received judgment that none of his descendants would sit on the throne of David (Jeremiah 22:30). But... a virgin birth would prevent this. And this is proven at the end of Matthew's genealogy where "whom," the Greek word ὅς ([os](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3739/nkjv/tr/0-1/)), is in the feminine form, which points back to Mary, also in the feminine form:

> And Jacob begot Joseph (**masculine form**) the husband of Mary (**feminine form**), of whom (**feminine form**) was born Jesus who is called Christ.

### Joseph's Father
And now for Luke's genealogy. To understand this, we have to first see the supposed contradiction.

| Luke's  | Matthew's  |
|---|---|
| Luke 3:23 (Heli)  | Matthew 1:16 (Jacob)  |

Luke mentions *Heli* as the father of Joseph, yet Matthew mentions *Jacob* as Joseph's father. I'll admit, at the surface, this does appear to be a contradiction. However, you might be surprised to see the answer is much simpler than what skeptics make this out to be. The Mosaic Law accounted for [Levirate Marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage#:~:text=Levirate%20marriage%20is%20a%20type,outside%20the%20clan%20is%20forbidden.), which essentially states that, if a brother passes away and leaves a widow, their surviving brother would marry his sister-in-law to preserve the family line (Numbers 27:1-11 and Numbers 36:1-12). This being the case, there's no issue that Joseph's legal father would be Mary's father, Heli. 

## Putting it all Together
As succinctly put as possible: Matthew traces Joseph's lineage, while Luke traces Mary's lineage. Joseph's lineage is traced to prove kingship with David (another necessary point his Jewish audience would have been familiar with)--even though his being a direct descendent of Jeconiah--Matthew is careful to end the lineage by pointing in the Greek to Mary, the Blessed Virgin, since a virgin birth prevents direct blood-relation to Jeconiah. This same mindfulness is found in Luke's Gospel, how he starts the genealogy with stating Joseph was the *supposed* father (Luke 3:23) of our Lord Jesus. This all correlates with the Levirate Marriage since Joseph would be *of* Heli, not *from* Heli.

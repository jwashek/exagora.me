## Intro
A lot of Christians don't understand just how lucky we are by having access to the Bible. We belong to a generation today that all Christians in previous generations, and certainly the early Church, would no doubt be envious of. We are but a fraction of Christians throughout history that can say we have full access to *all* of God's Word--and right at our fingertips. Sadly, we don't always consider how lucky we are with this truth. But how did we get to this point in history? How did the Bible get to be what it is today? And let's be honest, if we live by the Bible and walk by faith in Jesus, we need to know and understand how our Bible came to be. If not, how are we expected to contend earnestly for the faith [(Jude :3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%203&version=NKJV) and defend our position against unbelievers?

## Misconceptions
Let's first address a few misconceptions that are commonly reported by skeptics about the Bible. 

| Misconception | Truth  |
|---|---|
| People determined what should be in the Bible  | People *discovered* books of the Bible, they didn't necessarily *determine* it (more on this later)  |
| The books in the Bible were written hundreds of years after Christ  | This misconception applies mainly to the New Testament since it explicitly mentions Jesus; however, it's widely accepted between scholars that the New Testament books were written from 44 A.D. to 95 A.D.<sup>[1](https://www.biblegateway.com/blog/2016/02/when-was-each-book-of-the-bible-written/)</sup>. However, there is a *slight* truth to this claim since we don't have the originals, only copies of copies of copies which do date to past the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> centuries  |
| The Bible was written all at one time  | The first book of the Bible is thought to have been written anywhere from 1500 B.C. to 2000 B.C.<sup>[2](https://www.oldest.org/religion/books-in-the-bible/)</sup> or even possibly later, and the last book was written around 95 A.D.<sup>[3](https://www.gty.org/library/questions/QA176/when-were-the-bible-books-written)   |
| The Bible was written by people to obtain notoriety or fame | Most of the disciples and other early Christians were martyred or crucified<sup>[4](https://overviewbible.com/how-did-the-apostles-die/)</sup> and died for the sake of the gospel and the books that they held  |

## The Canon
### What is the Canon?
The canon is a collection of inspired books grouped together into a completed form. Or, as the [Gospel Coalition](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-biblical-canon/) puts it:

> *The biblical canon is the collection of scriptural books that God has given his corporate people, which are distinguished by their divine qualities, reception by the collective body, and their apostolic connection, either by authorship or association.*<sup>[5](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-biblical-canon/)</sup>

This definition does a fantastic job in helping us to, as we'll see later, understand how the books were assembled and how they were determined to be included in the canon of Scripture.

### Brief History
From the moment Jesus died at around 33 A.D., creedal traditions were already being recited, written, and carried upon fellow believers. These creeds were found to be the earliest manuscript evidence supporting Christianity<sup>[6](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/earliest-evidence-christianity/)</sup> and dated anywhere from 1-6 years after Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The creed went as follows:

> Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures...
> he was buried...
> he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures

If this sounds like something straight from the Bible, that's because it is! This very creed was later added in [1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 15:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A3-4&version=ESV) about 10-15 years later (~44-54 A.D.). Since those moments after Christ's resurrection and the decades to follow, the New Testament books were slowly being written by the likes of the apostles and other witnesses such as Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter, James, and Jude. The last written book of the Bible was thought to be that of the Gospel of John or Revelation, but regardless of what the last written book might be, it's widely accepted that it was written in 95 A.D. Not even 100 years later, around 170 A.D., the [Muratorian Canon](https://www.julianspriggs.co.uk/Pages/MuratorianCanon) was compiled. This included *all* New Testament books except Hebrews, James, 1<sup>st</sup> Peter, 2<sup>nd</sup> Peter, and 3<sup>rd</sup> John. As for the Old Testament, around 250-300 A.D., it was generally accepted that the Hebrew canon of Scripture was complete<sup>[7](https://www.gotquestions.org/canon-Bible.html)[8](https://www.learnreligions.com/history-of-the-bible-timeline-700157)</sup> and recognized as official, authoritative canon. Athanasius of Alexandria in 367 A.D. identified all 27 books of the New Testament for the first time in history<sup>[8](https://www.learnreligions.com/history-of-the-bible-timeline-700157)</sup>. This means that after Christ died in ~33 A.D., it took about 330 years to have a compiled, accepted, recognized, and completed Bible. Now that we understand a bit of the history, how were these books assembled?

### How the Bible Was Assembled
#### The Old Testament
Jews took their traditions very seriously. One of these traditions was how they handled God's Word. A lot of the Old Testament books were assembled by being transcribed, copied, and transferred down from generation to generation<sup>[9](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/how-was-the-bible-put-together.html)</sup> either orally or written. One of the particularly interesting things about how the Old Testament came to be assembled was that of the Masoretes. These were Jewish scholars whose focus was to retain the true oral and written traditions of the Bible and remove any alterations that might have occurred during Babylonian captivity. This work became what we know today as the Masoretic Text<sup>[10](https://www.gotquestions.org/Masoretic-Text.html)</sup>. The Masoretes were *highly* accurate in how they copied the texts, since they hand-copied letter-for-letter and only allowed trusted individuals from specific communities to do so. This text was dated to around the 10<sup>th</sup> century<sup>[11](https://overviewbible.com/masoretic-text/)</sup>. That might seem like a too-recent date for the Old Testament, right? Now, here's the interesting thing. Scholars have confirmed the utmost accuracy of the Masoretic Text after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint which were written *centuries* before the Masoretic Text (2<sup>nd</sup> century A.D.). The Masoretic Text was shown to agree with both discoveries besides minor textual variances (missed punctuation, misspellings, or grammar mistakes, i.e., no major doctrinal errors, additions, or subtractions). 

#### The New Testament
Putting the New Testament books of the Bible together was a little different and presented many challenges. Mainly because Christians were heavily persecuted by the Romans during the 1<sup>st</sup> century. Christians were being hunted down and killed for even having these books. But on the other hand, there were so many copies circulating that most of these books were becoming more and more available. Christians would meet up and bring their books (often just letters that they hand-copied) with them. If they came across a book they did not personally own, they would copy these as well. Before they knew it, many Christians were carrying around much of what we see in the New Testament today. And those copies continued to multiply very rapidly throughout the years.

> __Note:__ It's also important to note, these texts all mentioned in this section (Masoretic Text, Dead Sea Scrolls, and Septuagint) are all copies. Maybe more accurately, these are *copies of copies of copies of copies...* In other words, these are far from the original texts since we don't have the originals. But through historical and archaeological records, scholars have been able to determine rough [estimates](https://www.biblegateway.com/blog/2016/02/when-was-each-book-of-the-bible-written/) of when the books of the Bible were written.

### Confirming Which Books to Include
Maybe a question you might have is, "*How was it determined what books were to be included in the Bible?*" Enter the councils! Essentially, these councils included many scholars of those days which used various criteria to determine whether Scriptures were inspired by God. Some of these criteria that scholars used during these councils included<sup>[12](https://www.learnreligions.com/when-was-the-bible-assembled-363293)</sup>:

  * **Apostolicity** - Was the book written by one of Jesus' disciples, connected to an apostle, or was it written by an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry?
  * **Consistency** - Is the book consistent with other portions of the Bible known to be valid? 
  * **Orthodoxy** - Does the book line up with the teachings of Jesus and the apostles?
  * **Timeliness** - Was the book written in the first century A.D. and not long after the events of Jesus?

> __Note:__ It's important to note two things here. First, that the above criteria relates only to the New Testament. This is due to the simple fact that the Hebrew canon was already widely accepted to be canon. Additionally, a council (Council of Jamnia<sup>[13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/stewart_don/faq/right-books-in-old-testament/question16-was-hebrew-canon-after-christ.cfm)</sup>) which supposedly addressed Old Testament canon was, and still is, hotly debated with scholars still not able to agree on its significance, its reliability, or even if this council addressed which books to add to the canon. Second, nobody *determined* what books were supposed to be included within the canon of Scripture, they discovered these books and used various criteria to understand which books were divinely inspired.

#### Council of Laodicea (A.D. 364)
This council was not as major as the [Council of Nicea](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/First_Council_of_Nicaea), but it was important, nonetheless. This council had its hand in confirming the books of the Bible, that they were canon, and that only canonical books should be read in the churches<sup>[14](https://sabbathsentinel.org/2016/11/10/council-of-laodicea-364-ad/)</sup>.

#### Council of Carthage (A.D. 397)
We don't know much about this council, but what we do know is, much like the Council of Laodicea, the attendants confirmed the books of the Bible as canon<sup>[15](https://www.gotquestions.org/Council-of-Carthage.html)</sup>. Like the Council of Laodicea, this council determined the [Apocrypha](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-is-the-apocrypha) was **not** considered inspired, and therefore not included within canon. There is still to this day much debate about the Apocrypha. And several councils to follow the Council of Carthage did determine these to be canon, but again, that was widely debated throughout the centuries whereas in previous councils, they were confirming what the books were already considered to be canon.  

## Conclusion
Understanding how the Bible came to be is important for Christians to bolster their faith. I wanted to start this topic with several misconceptions about the Bible that I've heard from skeptics which might include attacks on how the books were determined or selected to be in the canon, how the books were written hundreds of years after Christ, or that the Bible was written all at one time. After these misconceptions were addressed, we investigated a brief history of the canon and just how early it came to be almost fully assembled (170 A.D.). Finally, we went over how the books were assembled and compiled, which eventually led to them being confirmed at several councils as canon and to be read in churches. This topic is very vast, and I was only able to scratch the surface of what I wanted to dive into, but this is a great start to lay a foundation that we can build on.

## Intro
Scientists agree that the universe had a beginning. Several facts point to this claim such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the universe's constant expansion, the radiation afterglow, and even Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity--to name a few. But why is this important to proving God's existence? Well, if the universe had a beginning, we could use deductive reasoning and assume that it came from somewhere or something--something that is timeless, spaceless, and immaterial. If you walk into a room and notice a computer on a desk, your first thought would never be, "this computer assembled itself!" This is true for all things that we know in our reality. All paintings had a painter; all constructs had a constructor; all creation had a creator.

## In The Beginning
### Second Law of Thermodynamics
This law suggests that the universe is running down because, overtime, energy is wasted and constantly degenerates into a more disorderly state [1](https://www.livescience.com/50941-second-law-thermodynamics.html). If the universe is running down as this law suggests, we would have no energy left at this very moment if the universe was eternal or timeless; we wouldn't be here. Another way of putting it might be to suggest the universe was "wound up," much like a wind-up toy that you might have had as a child. We can observe this very law in practice in this case. You wind up the toy, the toy runs for a time, but it eventually winds down and powers off. How did it get wound up in the first place? Something wound it up!

### Universe expanding
Edwin Hubble was thought to be one of the first to recognize the universe had a finite age due to its constant expansion [2](https://hubblesite.org/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/measuring-the-universes-expansion-rate), though most scientists at that time still believed the universe was timeless. In addition to this, Hubble theorized that everything in our universe came from a single point of infinite density--a singularity--which is actually nothing and thought to be a black hole [3](https://phys.org/news/2016-02-big-black-hole.html). But then we have the same question, where did this point of singularity come from? The First Law of Thermodynamics seems to suggest that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred [4](https://www.livescience.com/50881-first-law-thermodynamics.html). If energy was in fact transferred from this singularity, then the singularity would have to have had a beginning itself or had energy transferred to it, because the energy coming from it could not have come from nothing or nowhere. Alternatively, if the singularity has infinite density, then how has this not spawned several other Big Bangs since then? If it has infinite density, it's incalculable, immeasurable, and thus immaterial. Hubble's theory ironically points to a Creator in an indirect manner. He is saying that something immaterial created our universe--which is precisely what Creationism suggests.  

### Radiation Afterglow
In 1965, two employees of Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, intended to utilize a large antenna for different tasks such as to map the Milky Way and measure space between galaxies [5](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dp65co.html). What they discovered was far more interesting than any of those things, though. Penzias and Wilson discovered there was remnant heat thought to be from the Big Bang still out there, which proved there was a beginning. Why this is important to note is because, at that time, many scholars and scientists agreed that the universe was timeless. So, you could imagine how this discovery shook the scientific community.  

### Theory of Relativity
Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity proved that time, space, and matter are co-relative, came into existence together, and are inextricably connected [6](https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html); they too had a beginning. And how would they, being so disparate in nature from one another, be so interconnected to the point that they cannot exist without one another and even came into existence at the very same time? This being the case, can't we conclude that something which possibly transcends time, space, and matter caused them to come into existence? And if so, this thing needs to be timeless, spaceless, and immaterial. In other words, it cannot be governed by the very same laws that it created.

## God Created
### Computer Analogy
Enter God. Think of time, space, and matter in a different way. Suppose you are the creator of the computer. And, by computer, I mean *everything* about a computer: the cables, the monitor, the mouse and keyboard, and every protocol that governs communication, networking, and the binary language of sending/receiving information. If you, being the creator of the computer, are wanting to send an email to a co-worker, do you jump inside the monitor, convert binary bits from 0 to 1 or vice versa, then collect all the packets and place it on the physical cable to be sent to them? No, of course not! You exist entirely outside of your creation, and you are not held to the very laws that you created. The same is true with time, space, and matter, but it's at an obviously much larger and incomprehensible scale to us--since everything we know is affected by time, space, and matter. With even just one of these plucked from the other two, we would cease to exist. Time and matter without space means we do not have a place to exist. Matter and space without time means we do not have a time to exist. Time and space without matter means we do not have the material to exist. God is timeless, spaceless, and immaterial because He is the Creator of those very things; He is not held to the laws that He created. 

### Ford Illustration
Dr. John Lennox presents a different side of this argument defending Creationism. His illustration of the "*cause of the Model T*" is put this way: suppose you have a Ford Model T, what accounts for the motorcar? Henry Ford, the creator, or the laws of internal combustion? You need Henry Ford to create the car and you need the laws of internal combustion to allow the car to operate; both are required [7](https://www.monergism.com/why-god-henry-ford). You can study the Model T, its engine, how it works and operates, but you will never disprove the existence of Henry Ford. The more you learn about the car, the more the evidence points to a designer or creator. Henry Ford is not part of the car or existing within the car, he just created it. God is not part of the universe in the sense that He's affected by the very laws that govern it; He just created those laws to operate within His creation. 

## The Heaven and the Earth
### Cosmic Fine-Tuning
**Expansion Rate**<br>
Scientists have discovered that the universe is so precisely fine-tuned that if you were to change any number of factors about our universe, there would be no universe itself or no universe that could support life. Consider Stephen Hawking's quote [8](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/stephen_hawking_627128):

> "*If the rate of expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, it would have collapsed before it reached its present size. On the other hand, if it had been greater by a part in a million, the universe would have expanded too rapidly for stars and planets to form*."

This number is far too precise to have happened entirely out of chance, wouldn't you agree? 

**Gravitational Force**<br>
Like the expansion rate of the universe, if the gravitational force would be altered more than 1 part in 10^40^, stars would cease to exist--this means our sun. If the sun didn't exist, obviously neither would we. Think of this in relation to something we might be able to understand a little better. If you spread a tape measure across the entire known universe and you set the gravitational force at any spot on the tape measure, if the strength of gravity were to differ by just one inch in either direction, we would not exist. This would be a sort of scale that we could understand with 10^40^ precision. 

Did this number come by chance or was it designed this way?

**Precise Distance**<br>
Consider our earth in relation to its distance from the sun. Scientists often call the earth's location in our solar system the "Goldilocks Zone." If we were closer than our current measurement to the sun, we'd burn; if we were further than our current measurement to the sun, we'd freeze. The earth is in just the right spot to sustain life. 

**Jupiter**<br>
Jupiter's massive size and gravitational pull attracts most meteors and space debris to itself rather than earth. Meaning, if Jupiter were not there, or if it didn't have the current gravitational pull that it does, the earth would likely have been obliterated by meteors much before humans ever arrived on earth--or even right at this moment. There is at least one mark on Jupiter that is known to have been caused by an asteroid, leaving an impact site much larger than the size of earth [9](https://www.space.com/jupiter-impacts-observation-science). 

## And It Was Good
### Laws of Nature
Why does gravity *always* work, never glitching and causing us to float up through the atmosphere? Why does an acorn *always* create an oak tree, never an oak tree or even something that isn’t a tree, like a raccoon? It’s because they were designed in a very specific way. We observe the same kind of consistency in every Law of Nature in existence. These laws are precise in the sense that they always accomplish the same task with accuracy; consistent in the sense that they always produce the same results; and persistent in the sense that they always work the same way with no deviation. The chances of these laws to operate with the precision, consistency, and persistency that they do are slim to none. 

Speaking of chance, let's investigate some interesting probabilities in relation to our universe.


### Chance? Never Heard of Him
Humans typically consider a 10^45^ chance of occurrence to be impossible. Harold Morowitz of Yale University calculated the probability of the formation of the smallest and simplest living organism to be one in 10^340,000,000^ [10](https://apologeticspress.org/god-and-the-laws-of-science-the-laws-of-probability-3726/). Just a few short years after this calculation, Carl Sagan made his own estimation of the chance that life could evolve on any given single planet. He calculated it to be one in 10^2,000,000,000^. That is 1 with 2 billion zeros after it! The chances are so fractionally small of this to occur that it's hard for us to even comprehend. You also must bring into consideration **all** events leading up to where we are right now. That is,

* the Big Bang itself,
* the formation of life on a single planet,
* evolving of life to intelligent beings, etc.

All of these coupled together would *drastically* increase this already incomprehensible probability even more exponentially, and possibly even immeasurably. We are here by incalculable odds, all from matter that was created out of nowhere and that exploded with such force, that over the course of billions of years, we evolved into intelligent beings and still cannot reason within ourselves how we got here or what our purpose is for? 

### Faith in Science vs God
You may have heard people say, "*trust the Science*" but what does science say? Science is an organized body of knowledge based on sets of data that can be interpreted and confirmed through experimentation. Science says nothing—*Scientists* do. "Trusting the science" is not trusting science; it's trusting a human who interprets science. The choice is between trusting in fallible humans’ interpretation of data about the universe and trusting in a God who created the universe.

Where is your faith? Are you trusting in a finite human being's weak attempt at understanding creation, or a timeless, spaceless, immaterial Creator?  

## Conclusion
Using deductive reasoning by what we now know of the universe having a point in time of creation, we can infer that *something* transcends time, space, and matter that brought the universe into existence. There is no other example that we can conjure up where the creator of **any** object is governed by the creation. The creator of a car does not abide by the laws of internal combustion, a painter does not live within their painting, nor do the creators of the computer interpret conversation through converting binary (1s and 0s). If the universe had a beginning, the logical implication would be that whatever created the universe would be timeless, spaceless, and immaterial. The only thing that even remotely describes this is God.

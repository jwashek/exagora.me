## Intro
With the plethora of religions we see in the world, the honest question tends to arise: "*What makes Christianity true?*" Often, skeptics like to add, "*there are thousands of religions...*" to this question so as to give the appearance that finding the true religion is an insurmountable task. Surely, it's not an easy answer or quick task to prove since there's a lot of complexity to a question like that. But I do think we can cook it down to be more digestible for us to defend against as Christians. For example, instead of fearing this question, we can examine it deeper. A good starting point in this examination is understanding just how many religions there are. This helps us tremendously because if we narrow the search results down, we can apply evidence to a smaller set of religions to sift out the truth. And that's what I hope to do in this post: sift out the religions and show how Christianity holds the truth. 

## Narrowing It Down
Below is a table of the top 10 religions by practicing followers. 

| Religion  | Followers  |
|---|---|
| 1. Christianity  | 2.4 billion  |
| 2. Islam  | 1.9 billion  |
| 3. Hinduism  | 1.2 billion  |
| 4. Buddhism  | 500 million  |
| 5. Folk Religion  | 400 million  |
| 6. Shinto  | 100 million  |
| 7. Taoism  | 12-173 million  |
| 8. Vodou  | 60 million  |
| 9. Sikhism  | 25-30 million  |
| 10. Judaism  | 14.5 million  |

The point I'm trying to defend against here isn't so much *what makes Christianity true* (yet), but to defend another claim that *there are thousands of religions*. Have you ever used a GPS and almost arrived at your destination, but for some reason you turned down the radio? There's something about silencing the noise that helps us focus on our goal. That's my attempt here: silencing the noise by showing the facts. The fact of the matter is, there really aren't thousands of religions--and if there were, the number of followers would be so low that that particular religion is insignificant to even consider. Look carefully again at the table. Notice how the number of followers drop drastically even within the top 10. You start with #1 being at 2.4 billion followers to #10 being a mere 14.5 million followers. Imagine if there *were* thousands of religions. How many followers would there realistically be at the #1,000 religion? How many would there be even at #100? What about outside of the top 25? Once you get outside of that range, we're not talking millions of followers anymore, but thousands. And it's easier to prove one religion over the other by first silencing the noise.

Now, don't pick out what I'm not trying to say here. Just because one religion is #1 doesn't mean that it's true. In other words, the number of followers should not come into consideration in the religion being true. On the other hand, just because another religion only has a few million followers (or a few thousand) doesn't mean that it's inherently untrue. But it does help to turn down the noise so we can find our way to our goal: the truth. And let's face it, if there are only a few hundred, few thousand, or few million followers of a particular religion, what is that religion lacking in terms of the others? Is there something holding them back from gaining traction in receiving more followers?  

## Look At the Evidence
Now we arrive at the logical answer to the two questions posed in the previous section: evidence. This is where we should focus when attempting to prove one religion over the other. Applying evidence to a smaller set of religions makes our lives in finding the true religion a much easier task. And it just so happens that Christianity has evidence. And *lots* of it. 

### Manuscripts
The Bible has 40,000 ancient manuscripts[[<sup>1</sup>]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrqkaKz_SSg&t=690) supporting and corroborating its validity. This is important because no other religion can hold a candle to the amount of evidence supporting it. In reality, no other book or any other historical artifact in antiquity--religious or not--holds anywhere near the amount of manuscriptural evidence. Take Islam for example, the 2nd religion based on followers. The earliest evidence was found in the 8th Century and there are roughly 1,800 ancient manuscripts[[<sup>2</sup>]](https://www.lib.umich.edu/collections/collecting-areas/special-collections-and-archives/islamic-manuscripts). If manuscripts were any indicator of which religion might be considered true, then Christianity certainly has this in the bag.

> __Note:__ Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and a small handful of other religions have factual historical claims. But, Christianity is the most reliable and supported by far. Even atheist/agnostic secular scholars would agree[[<sup>3</sup>]](https://equip.sbts.edu/article/every-religion-claims-historical-christianity/#:~:text=Bart%20Ehrman).

### Eyewitnesses
One thing that's hard to claim with religions of old are eyewitness testimonies. However, Christianity has lots of eyewitness testimonies as well. In 1 Corinthians 15:5-8, Paul makes the claim that there were over 500 eyewitness accounts of Jesus' appearance after His resurrection. I know what you may be thinking, "*Yeah, but that's in the Bible and you can't use the Bible to support the Bible*." And I would agree--which is why I would like to point out that this exact claim of eyewitness testimonies came by way of creedal manuscripts[[<sup>4</sup>]](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/earliest-evidence-christianity/#:~:text=But%20followers%20of%20Jesus%20need%20to%20be%20aware) much earlier before Paul wrote this in 1st Corinthians. This creedal manuscript was found *very* shortly after Jesus' death in ~33 AD and has been dated to have been written between ~34 AD to ~39 AD. In other words, this creedal manuscript is evidence existing outside of the Bible--and the earliest supporting evidence to Christianity that we currently have.

> __Note:__ This creedal manuscript has been called "the pearl of great price" and has even been said by [atheist scholars](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/earliest-evidence-christianity/#:~:text=called%20this%20discovery) to be "one of the great achievements of recent New Testament scholarship".

### Extra-Biblical
#### Ancient Historians
Though the creedal manuscript is a form of extra-biblical evidence, there are actually many more pieces of evidence existing outside of the Bible. There are several secular, non-religious--and sometimes haters of Jesus and Christians--accounts from historians that support Jesus' existence and the claims which the Bible and Christianity make. Many of these historians existed in the 1st Century, either during or very shortly after Jesus' ministry on earth. Some of these secular sources include[[<sup>5</sup>]](https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/is-there-any-evidence-for-jesus-outside-the-bible/):

* Thallus (52 AD)
* Tacitus (56-120 AD)
* Mara Bar-Serapion (70 AD)
* Phlegon (80-140 AD)
* Pliny the Younger (61-113 AD)
* Suetonius (69-140 AD)
* Lucian of Samosata: (115-200 AD)
* Celsus (175 AD)
* Josephus (37-101 AD)

Even in some of the harder-to-prove claims made in the Bible, these are still supported in ancient writings outside of the Bible. Some of these claims in the Bible corroborated by secular sources include: darkness over the whole land (supported by Thallus, Josephus, and others; found in Matthew 27:45), a giant earthquake (supported by Thallus, Phlegon, Josephus, and others; found in Matthew 27:54), Jesus being prosecuted by Pontius Pilate (supported by Tacitus; found in Matthew 27:1-2), Jesus being born of a virgin (supported by Celsus; found in Matthew 1:23), etc. There are many other claims, I would highly encourage to dive into these historians as their support line up accurately with Scripture and are truly fascinating. 

> __Note:__ Why *Jesus being prosecuted by Pontius Pilate* is a hard-to-prove claim is because skeptics have claimed for decades that there's no supporting evidence for Pontius Pilate. This was true up until the year of 1961 when the "Pilate Stone"[[<sup>6</sup>]](https://aleteia.org/2018/06/15/archaeological-evidence-of-pontius-pilate-corroborates-gospel/) was found. In addition to this, Pontius Pilate's ring was supposedly found just a few short years ago (as of this post's writing) in 2018[[<sup>7</sup>]](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/inscriptions/pontius-pilate-ring-herodium/).

#### Seismic Activity
Even more interesting, an article from 2012 shows that geologist researchers claimed to have pinpointed Jesus' death on the cross to the very day by tracing seismic activity in accordance to the Bible's claim found in Matthew 27:50-51[[<sup>8</sup>]](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna47555983).

> __Note:__ I would highly encourage to read the full [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna47555983) regarding this, as it points to more evidence to why April 3rd seems to be the date of Jesus' death by using claims found in and outside of the Bible. 

## Fulfilled Prophecy
Scripture has anywhere from 1,500 to 2,500 prophecies foretold within. This sets it uniquely apart from any other religion in the entire world. But what also sets Christianity apart are those prophecies being fulfilled. What I tried to do was pick more tangible prophecies that have extra-biblical tendencies. By that I mean, I chose a handful of prophecies that aren't foretelling things like Jesus' death on the cross or resurrection--even though these prophecies were written some hundreds of years before Christ and have secular sources verifying these claims. But since these prophecies were foretold in the Bible and seen as fulfilled in the Bible (at least as we see it almost 2,000 years later), skeptics typically discredit prophecies like these immediately. So here are a few that can't be discredited.

### Israel Restored as a Nation
Ezekiel 37:7-12 and Jeremiah 16:15 are often the most well-known prophecies as it relates to the restoration of Israel. Israel was declared a nation in 1948[[<sup>9</sup>]](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/us-israel), something that hasn't been declared to that effect probably since the birth of Israel. Take a look into Israel's history and you'll see just how important this prophecy is. Jews were displaced from Israel for hundreds of years prior to 1948, ruled by other nations, conquered, and dominated by Muslims--you name it; Israel has a very dark past filled with lots of tribulation.

### Destruction of Jerusalem
Jeremiah 25:2,9–11 foretells the destruction of Jerusalem. This very thing happened by the Babylonians which sieged Jerusalem and utterly destroyed them in 587 B.C. This is one of those prophecies that's impossible to deny as there's so much history supporting this fulfilled prophecy[[<sup>10</sup>]](https://www.thehistoryville.com/nebuchadnezzar-destroyed-jerusalem/).

### Temple Being Destroyed
In Luke 21:5-6, Jesus predicts one of the most historically supported prophecies: the destruction of the Jewish temple. This occurred in 70 AD[[<sup>11</sup>]](https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/josephus.html#:~:text=In%2070%20AD%2C%20the%20Romans,the%20terror%20of%20Nero's%20reign.) when Roman-led Titus commanded the charge and pilfered, plundered, and completely destroyed the temple located in Jerusalem. Jesus' words, "*not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down*," truly came to pass as you can see for yourself:

## Conclusion
Maybe the most asked question from skeptics and atheists is, "*What makes Christianity true?*" A lot of times, this is asked with additional context that skeptics like to add, "*Of the thousands of religions...*" My attempt at this post was to answer both of these questions and show that (1) there actually aren't that many religions, and (2) Christianity is true because of prolific amounts of supported evidence--both inside and outside the Bible--eye witness testimonies, and fulfilled prophecies. We explored some of the evidence supporting Christianity here, but I would highly encourage anyone, believer or unbeliever, to search the data yourselves--you might be shocked at what you find.

## Intro
One of the toughest questions for a Christian to answer is that of, "*if God is good, why does He allow evil to exist?*" Many skeptics use this question as a sort of ace-in-the-hole since it's common that most Christians will not know how to answer, or even flat-out avoid this question altogether. However, like any tough question, there's always an answer. Evil might be allowed from God due to our free will, the ripple effect, or even our limited understanding of His ways. Since this question really revolves around a logical issue, my attempt with this post is to provide logical reasoning with little to no support from the Bible. 

## Evil Proves Good
Since evil exists, we can assume that good also exists. The reason being that if we *know* something is evil, we must have a sort of measure or scale to compare an evil act against--in order for us to even know it is evil in the first place. There's something inside of us that knows it's inherently wrong to murder, rape, or kidnap (among other selfish and senseless acts), so we choose not to perform these actions (remember the word `choose`, that'll be important later). Yet others still commit these heinous acts. Why? I'll ask an even tougher question, "*why doesn't God intervene in those situations?*" Have you ever considered, that if God stopped all evil, He would need to start with us? We're all evil in God's eyes. His standard is perfection, and we miss the mark every single day. Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever disobeyed your parents? These are minor acts in our eyes, but in God's eyes, these are very serious evil acts deserving of punishment. The mere fact that evil exists proves that good exists, and if good exists, there must be something that is the Author of good. Now, you may be asking, "*if God created good, then didn't He create evil?*"

> "*Evil comes from the abuse of free will* -- C.S. Lewis"

## Free Will
The answer to that question is easier than people lead on. No, He didn't create evil, because God has given us free will! Evil quite simply comes from choice--choosing to abuse our God-given free will. We choose to do good or to do evil. If someone gets it in their mind to break into someone else's house and steal all their belongings, but suppresses the urge to do so, they made a conscious choice to do good. Conversely, if that same person went along with robbing the house, they made a clear choice to perform evil, driven by their own selfish desire, lust, or envy. Freedom without choice is not free. If there's no choice, then there's truly no freedom. It has been said before that:

> "*God is responsible for the **fact** of freedom, but humans are responsible for the **acts** of freedom.*"

If God truly gave us free will but intervened in every evil act, then we wouldn't have free will; we wouldn't have a choice. God does not force you to believe in Him so much as He doesn't force you to choose what clothes you put on in the morning. 

## The Ripple Effect
A second reason that God might allow evil is due to the ripple effect--sometimes also referred to as the "Butterfly Effect." To put it in a different way, one event may ripple forward and shape another--or many--future events in a way that might not have occurred if the first event never had happened. We cannot, as finite human beings, *possibly* trace all those events from a given, single event. Let's use an example. What if a child is diagnosed with and dies from a new rare form of cancer. A true tragedy that we cannot even fathom why God would allow that to happen. Now, what if that specific child dying caused a ripple of events where, several decades later, a new medical breakthrough is discovered for that child's particular rare form of cancer? And from that very breakthrough, a cure is found for **all** forms of cancer? Sometimes, we think we need to know all the answers **right now**, and unfortunately this is almost never the case--some things we simply cannot know. 

## Limited Understanding
Our limited understanding of God is a third reason that God might allow evil. If God truly is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, how can we understand His ways and say that we can do things better? If we can fully understand a timeless, immaterial, spaceless, and eternal being in our tiny little brains, is that a god worthy of being worshipped? We certainly are not all-knowing, though we tend to act the opposite sometimes. It was said by a famous preacher in the early 1800s:   

> "*If God were to give me His power for 24 hours, you would see how many changes I would make in this world, but if He gave me his wisdom too, I would leave things as they are.* -- J.M.L. Monsabre"

Our understanding is limited. Our wisdom is limited even further. We cannot understand God's ways in why He chooses to allow evil, but one thing we *can* understand is that we *can't* understand everything.

## Conclusion
Why does God allow evil? Free will is one way to explain this question in that we are given the freedom to choose. When we abuse that free will is when evil is created. Another reason for God's allowing of evil could be due to the ripple effect. We cannot trace all events from a single event, so there would be no way for any human to see so far in the future that all the answers are given to us. Our view of evil might be our present perception, but what about decades or even centuries into the future? That "evil" event may bring more good than we could ever imagine. Lastly, our limited understanding of God and His ways is a third way to answer this question. If God is truly how we view Him, i.e., omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, then we cannot begin to fathom His ways or begin to know what He knows.

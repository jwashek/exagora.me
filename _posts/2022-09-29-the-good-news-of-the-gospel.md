## TL;DR
The bad news is we've all sinned. With this "sin" comes a deadly consequence: death. The good news is: a Savior came to save us from our sin. A Savior who ransomed us by His blood, defeated death, and will establish His reign as King and Lord at His second coming. Our response to this message is to repent (change our mind), believe in the King, become baptized into Him, and live obedient lives to our new King. 

## The Bad News
With the coming of good news, bad news typically precedes it. And it's no different here. Mankind has three chief enemies: sin, death, and the devil. Through the trickery of the devil, he caused Adam and Eve to sin (Genesis 3:1-15), thereby condemning them to the realm of which he controls: death (Hebrews 2:14-15). Since all are born into Adam and all have sinned (Romans 5:12,14), mankind itself became enslaved within the kingdom of the devil, filing into the realm of the dead, Hades (1 Peter 3:19 and 1 Peter 4:6), imprisoned therein with no hope of escape. Humanity needed saved from their sin, from its consequence (death), released from their imprisonment in Hades, and ransomed from the one who unjustly brought about their condemnation (the devil). Humanity needed a Savior. A new King.

## The Good News
Our King has come! The Lord Jesus made a way for us to be reconciled back to God the Father (Colossians 1:21-22); to be forgiven and cleansed of all our sin and unrighteousness (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, and Colossians 2:13), and to have the hope of life everlasting (John 3:15-16, John 6:47, and John 3:36). And just how is all this possible?

Our King--the Word--was made flesh (John 1:1-2,14), became incarnate through the virgin Mary and born as the Lord Jesus, the Son of God--embracing both divinity and humanity in perfect union. He lived a sinless life (Hebrews 4:15 and 1 Peter 2:22) and made it possible for you and for me to be saved by His life (Romans 5:10), death (Philippians 2:8), and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:17). He gave His life as a ransom for all of humanity (Matthew 20:28 and 1 Timothy 2:6); His payment being His own blood (Hebrews 9:12-15). Through His death, He became our propitiation (1 John 4:10) by shedding His blood (Romans 3:25) on the Cross for our sakes and for our benefit.

## A Ransom for All
Imagine yourself being tricked into buying a new home. The seller knowingly sold you a house which is falling apart from within and one in which he knew you'd accrue endless debt upon. Your debt has piled up so much that there's no possible way you can make the monthly payments anymore. All of your neighbors have been duped by the same seller and they're plagued by the very same situation. They, including you, start serving the seller as a result, becoming deeper and deeper in bondage to him. One day, a Man comes by and offers to buy your house, to set you free from your debt, but with a catch: since you no longer have to live in that home, He wants to bring you to His home, allowing you to live there rent free--just under His rules. The debt is paid, so where will you decide to live?   

## What's Our Response? 
We need to follow our King home. We're either in the kingdom of darkness, or the kingdom of light; the kingdom of Satan, or the kingdom of God. Our response to the Gospel of the kingdom is as follows:

* Repenting and believing (Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15, Luke 13:3;5, John 1:12, John 3:15-16, John 3:36, John 5:24, John 6:47, Acts 3:19, Acts 16:31, Acts 17:30, Acts 20:21, and 2 Corinthians 7:9-10);
* Being baptized (Mark 16:16, John 3:5, Acts 2:38, Acts 22:16, Romans 6:3-4, Galatians 3:27, 1 Peter 3:21, and Titus 3:5); and
* Living faithful, obedient lives under the King (Matthew 5-7, Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 6:46, John 13:34-35, John 15:4-6;10, 1 John 1:5-7, 1 John 2:3-4, 1 John 3:6-10, and 1 John 3:23-24)

### Repent and Believe
> "But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man's salvation." -- Tertullian, [On Repentance](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian20.html)

You don't know you're under the wrong kingdom until someone tells you. But when this information is revealed to you, you must respond to this news through repentance (change of mind) and turning to Christ in faith (Romans 10:9-14 and Acts 20:21), as He is the Savior and only name under heaven through which salvation can be provided (Acts 4:12). But as Tertullian puts it above, a true change in mind (repentance) brings about a change in action and amendment of one's ways--showing our allegiance to our new King and what He has commanded.

### Baptism
Since we "must be born again" (John 3:3), how can we be reborn other than by first dying? And how is it that we die other than through baptism? We were all born under the curse of the 1st Adam, slaves to sin serving Satan within his own kingdom. But when we're baptized into Christ (Galatians 3:27), we've been baptized into His death (Romans 6:3 and Colossians 2:12); dying to our ties to Satan, utterly renouncing the Evil One and all he stands for. We become born again and regenerated under our new King, the 2nd Adam, through baptism (John 3:5, Titus 3:5, and Acts 2:38) and become descendants of His, no longer slaves to sin, but now slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:4-14). We are washed through the filth of our former sins and aligned to rising again to newness of life (Romans 6:4). 

### Life Under the King
Part of the "Great Commission" (Matthew 28:18-20), and the biggest part often overlooked, is to make disciples *teaching them to observe **all things** that [He] has commanded*. In other words, faithful obedience to Him. When we make the decision to follow Christ as our King, we are under Him and His authority as King. This means we are to obey what He commanded (John 15:10, Matthew, 7:21-23, 1 Corinthians 7:19, Luke 6:46, 1 John 2:3-4, and 1 John 3:23-24). Whether you like that or not, there's only two kingdoms. The kingdom in which you were saved from (Colossians 1:13), or the kingdom in which you were saved to. A way of life; a way of death. Therefore, let's be zealous within that kingdom, performing good works (Titus 2:14) since that's what we were created for (Ephesians 2:10). Not that these works themselves save us, but if we are to have a faith which works through love (1 Corinthians 13:1-13, Galatians 5:6, and 1 John 3:17-19), how else can we obey our King if we're not loving Him and loving others (Matthew 22:36-40)? If we're not following Him, we're denying Him (Titus 1:16). And how can we say we love Him or know Him if we're not obedient to Him (1 John 2:4)? May we *never* be found to have a faulty, destitue, dead faith (James 2:14-26).

## Intro
The Gospel means "good news" or "glad tidings" and according to the New Testament, it's how we're saved and wherein we stand (1 Corinthians 15:1-2). Therefore, it's crucial to understand what the Gospel is and why it's good news. The Gospel is often associated in the New Testament with the kingdom of God/heaven (Matthew 4:23, Matthew 9:35, Matthew 24:14, Mark 1:14, and Mark 1:15), which is why it's referred to as the "gospel of the kingdom." This will be more important later on, but as it stands now, this is what our Lord Jesus preached. He said the gospel of the kingdom was at hand and that we should repent and believe this "good news" (Mark 1:15). But this begs the question, *what is this good news and why is it good*? 

## The Bad News
With the coming of good news, bad news typically precedes it. And it's no different here. Mankind has three chief enemies: sin, death, and the devil. Through the trickery of the devil, he caused Adam and Eve to sin (Genesis 3:1-15), thereby condemning them to the realm of which he controls: death (Hebrews 2:14-15). Since all are born into Adam and all have sinned (Romans 5:12,14), mankind itself became enslaved within the kingdom of sin, filing into the realm of the dead, Hades (1 Peter 3:19 and 1 Peter 4:6), imprisoned therein with no hope of escape. Humanity needed saved from their sin, from its consequence (death), released from their imprisonment in Hades, and ransomed from the one who unjustly brought about their condemnation (the devil). Humanity needed a new King.

## The Good News
Our King has come! The Lord Jesus made a way for us to be reconciled back to God the Father (Colossians 1:21-22); to be forgiven and cleansed of all our sin and unrighteousness (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, and Colossians 2:13), and to have the hope of life everlasting (John 3:15-16, John 6:47, and John 3:36). And just how is all this possible?

There are only two kingdoms. The one in which we all were born into, under the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4), or the new King which could save us from the wicked king, and redeem us from our enslavement to him, its consequences, and all that it stands for.

The Word was made flesh (John 1:1-2,14), became incarnate through the virgin Mary and born as the Lord Jesus, the Son of God--embracing both divinity and humanity in perfect union. He lived a sinless life (Hebrews 4:15 and 1 Peter 2:22) and made it possible for you and for me to be saved by His life (Romans 5:10), death (Philippians 2:8), and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:17). He gave His life as a ransom for all of humanity (Matthew 20:28 and 1 Timothy 2:6); His payment being His own blood (Hebrews 9:12-15). Through His death, He became our propitiation (1 John 4:10) by shedding His blood (Romans 3:25) on the Cross for our sakes and benefit.

## A Ransom for All
Imagine yourself being tricked into buying a new home. The seller knowingly sold you a house which is falling apart from within and one in which he knew you'd accrue endless debt upon. Your debt has piled up so much that there's no possible way you can make the monthly payments anymore. All of your neighbors have been duped by the same seller and they're plagued by the very same situation. They, including you, start serving the seller as a result, becoming deeper and deeper in bondage to him. One day, a Man comes by and offers to buy your house, to set you free from your debt, but with a catch: since you no longer have to live in that home, He wants to bring you to His home, allowing you to live there rent free--just under His rules. He already set forth a down payment, but it's up to you to make the decision to follow Him home.   

## What's Our Response? 
We're either in the kingdom of darkness, or the kingdom of light; the kingdom of Satan, or the kingdom of God. Our response to the Gospel of the kingdom is as follows:

* Repenting and believing (Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15, Luke 13:3;5, John 1:12, John 3:15-16, John 3:36, John 5:24, John 6:47, Acts 3:19, Acts 16:31, Acts 17:30, Acts 20:21, and 2 Corinthians 7:9-10)
* Being baptized (Mark 16:16, John 3:5, Acts 2:38, Acts 22:16, Romans 6:3-4, Galatians 3:27, 1 Peter 3:21, and Titus 3:5)
* Faithfulness; Obedience; living under the King's commandments (Matthew 5-7, Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 6:46, John 13:34-35, John 15:4-6;10, 1 John 1:5-7, 1 John 2:3-4, 1 John 3:6-10, and 1 John 3:23-24)

### Repent and Believe
> "But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man's salvation." -- Tertullian, [On Repentance](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian20.html)

You don't know you're under the wrong kingdom until someone tells you. You don't know what your sin causes and where it leads until it's brought to your attention. But when this information is revealed to you, you must respond to this news through repentance (change of mind) and turning to Christ in faith (Romans 10:9-14 and Acts 20:21), as He is the Savior and only name under heaven through which salvation can be provided (Acts 4:12). But as Tertullian puts it above, a true change in mind (repentance) brings about a change in action and amendment of one's ways.

### Baptism
Since we "must be born again" (John 3:3), how can we be reborn other than by first dying? And how is it that we die other than through baptism? We were all born under the curse of the 1st Adam, slaves to sin serving Satan within his own kingdom. But when we're baptized into Christ (Galatians 3:27), we've been baptized into His death (Romans 6:3 and Colossians 2:12); dying to our ties to Satan, utterly renouncing the Evil One and all he stands for. We become born again and regenerated under our new King through baptism (John 3:5, Titus 3:5, and Acts 2:38) and become descendants of His, no longer slaves to sin, but now slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:4-14). 

### Live Under the King
Part of the "Great Commission" (Matthew 28:18-20), and the biggest part often overlooked, is to make disciples *teaching them to observe all things that [He] has commanded*. In other words, faithful obedience to Him. When we make the decision to follow Christ our King, we are under Him and His authority as King. This means we are to obey what He commanded (1 Corinthians 7:19, Luke 6:46, and 1 John 3:23-24). Whether you like that or not, there's only two kingdoms. The kingdom in which you were saved from (Colossians 1:13), or the kingdom in which you were saved to. Let's be zealous for good works (Titus 2:14), for we are His workmanship created for good works (Ephesians 2:10).

## Conclusion
We all have sinned and come short of Godâ€™s glory. And there are very serious consequences to that sin: death and an eternity separated from God in hell. This bad news seems grim, but in a lot of cases, good news comes with the bad. The good news is that Jesus came as God in the flesh to make it possible for us to be reconciled to God, to save us from our sin and from death, and to make a way for those sins to be forgiven. Our King has come, He died on the cross, was buried, and rose again to set us free.

## What is the Gospel?
> <u>1 Corinthians 15:1-4</u>:<br><br>
> **1** Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; <br>
> **2** By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. <br>
> **3** For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; <br>
> **4** And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures

As you can see from the passage in Scripture above, the Gospel is very clear. It is **nothing** more than the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's it. Adding or removing anything to this would make it a false gospel which should then be viewed as accursed like [Galatians 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201%3A8&version=KJV) says.

I thought it sufficient for the first post on this blog to be about the Gospel. It is utterly important and without it we cannot be saved. It is for this reason that Jesus said in [Mark 16:15b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16%3A15&version=KJV) to *go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature*. Jesus didn't die to pay our sin debt in full for no one to hear about it. Imagine you bought a gift for your child and hid it away in the closet. If you left it in the closet and never told your child about the gift, then how will they know you ever bought it for them? Just the same, the Gospel brings the free gift [(Ephesians 2:8-9)]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=KJV) of salvation for *all the world*; they just need to hear it and believe it.

## What Does It Mean?
The Gospel literally means `glad tidings` or what is most taught today: `good news`. These are both one and the same, but why would Jesus’ suffering on the Cross and dying a horrible, painful death *ever* be labeled as good news? Well, you must understand a few things in order to fully grasp why the Gospel is nothing short of good news and everything more than good news!

**The Bad News**<br>
Have you ever heard someone say, "do you want the good news first or the bad news?" Typically with good news, there comes bad news along with it. Maybe not in every case, but certainly in the case of the Gospel. First and foremost, the bad news starts with us. Every single person on this earth except for the Lord Jesus Christ has sinned [(Hebrews 4:15)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A15&version=KJV).

> <u>Romans 3:23</u>: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Knowing this comes the next part of the bad news. There are very real and serious consequences for our sin, namely death and hell. [Romans 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A12&version=KJV) mentions that by "*one man's sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned*." We inherited this nature from birth. It was never intended for us to die a physical death. If we die without believing and trusting in Jesus Christ, we will then die a second death--spiritually--and spend an eternity separated from Him in hell. 

> <u>Romans 6:23</u>: For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
> <u>2 Thessalonians 1:8:</u> In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ<br>
> <u>John 8:24</u>: I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<br>
> <u>Revelation 21:8</u>: But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
> <u>Revelation 20:14-15</u>:<br> 
> **14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
> **15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Sounds awful, right? That's because it is. Hopeless and helpless if we all have sinned, which we can clearly see that we have by the above Scriptures. But this is where the good news come into play!

**The Good News**<br>
> <u>Romans 5:8</u>: But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Some of the most beautiful verses in the Bible are often said to follow a "but." In the case of the above verse, this couldn't be truer! Jesus died for us to pay a debt he didn't owe that all might be saved through Him who believe--and He did this for us while we were *yet sinners*. He suffered horribly on the Cross to satisfy a debt we could never pay. He became the propitiation . If we simply believe, we are justified from all things as [Acts 13:39]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013%3A39&version=KJV) says! 

It is free from good works on our part [(Titus 3:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+3%3A5&version=KJV). We are justified through faith without the deeds of the Law, or another way of putting it would be to keep the Law [(Romans 3:28)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A28&version=KJV). That in and of itself is amazing news! I don’t know who coined the phrase, but this play on words has been repeated by many preachers today. 

> “*I am justified through faith in Jesus. It’s just-if-I’d never sinned!*” 


## How to Be Saved
The Bible is very clear on the Gospel as you saw. What else the Bible is very clear on is how to be saved. Now that you've heard the Gospel, have you changed your mind to believe it to be true? 

**Repent**<br>
Jesus played into the question of “*what can I do to be saved?*” when others would ask Him what they could do. He tends to answer the question differently between each individual that asked Him. This isn't because Jesus is confused, rather, this is because He worked to understand the heart of the person. One such case is of the rich young ruler in [Matthew 19:16-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:16-22&version=KJV). Essentially, the rich young ruler asked Jesus what he needed to do in order to be saved. Jesus told him to keep the Commandments. The rich young ruler said, "I kept these since I was young." Jesus then mentioned for him to sell all that he had and give to the poor. The Bible says that he went away sorrowful because he had great riches. He showed no repentance, and he proved his love for riches more than his desire to turn to God, i.e., his heart was far from God, and thus, far from the desire to be saved. I mentioned repentance, but just how important is that when considering salvation? The truth is repentance and faith go hand-in-hand.

> <u>Mark 1:15</u>: And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

Repent, translated from the Greek word "[metanoeō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3340/kjv/tr/0-1/)" means to "change one's mind." You see that we must first repent, or change our mind, before we believe. Had the rich young ruler changed his mind about what Jesus mentioned, he very well may have been saved. 

If you don't believe you need saved, you'll never go to a Savior. Just as Jesus said in [Mark 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A17&version=KJV) that "*they that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick*." If you don't believe you're sick, you'll never change your mind and go to the doctor. Repentance happens through seeing our condition before God and realizing our utter hopelessness in saving ourselves.

**Believe!**<br>
> <u>John 3:16</u>: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

It's that simple, yet so difficult for people to understand because they think, "what do *I* need to do?" Most people apply their own self-righteous efforts into salvation instead of fully trusting in Jesus, but as we already saw, it’s **nothing** that we can do on our end—it is purely apart from good works. These are those which trust in themselves and in their own works. This cannot save us as *all of our righteousness is as filthy rags* like [Isaiah 64:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A6&version=KJV) states. 


You might ask, "Okay, I get it, believe. But **what** am I supposed to believe?" This next verse explains just that. Found in the book of Ephesians, Paul writes to the Church at Ephesus:

> <u>Ephesians 1:13</u>: In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise

Notice several things here. If we walk the verse back, we see consecutive steps that occur before we are sealed by the Holy Spirit, which we receive **only** through belief [(John 7:39)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207%3A39&version=KJV):

**1st**: we hear the word of truth (i.e., the Gospel)<br>
**2nd**: we believe it and trust in Christ (i.e., the *whom* the verse is referencing back to)<br>
**3rd**: we are *sealed* with the Holy Spirit

That's it. It all points back to `believe`, but notice what we believe is very important. Believe the Gospel, the good news; the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If you believe this and place your trust in Jesus Christ to save you, the Bible is clear that you are saved. Not by some prayer, not by works (starting good works or stopping bad works); only through Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross are we saved through our faith in Him. Now that you've heard the Gospel, are you placing your faith in Jesus Christ to save you?

**The Thief On the Cross**<br>
> <u>Luke 23:39-43</u>:<br>
> **39** And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.<br>
> **40** But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
> **41** And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
> **42** And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br>
> **43** And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.

What an amazing picture of salvation! The thief on the cross showed his heart believed in Jesus Christ and trusted who He said He was. Though the word “repent” is never mentioned, it’s assumed that he changed his mind and turned to God—as we clearly see in his actions by sticking up for Jesus and rebuking the other thief who was mocking Him. 

**Step-By-Step Guide to Salvation**<br>
1. Recognize you are a sinner
2. Understand the penalty for sin and your need of a Savior
3. Repent (change your mind) and believe the Gospel; trust Jesus Christ to save you

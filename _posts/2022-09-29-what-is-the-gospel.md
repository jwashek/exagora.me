## Intro
The Gospel means `good news` or `glad tidings` and is very clear according to the Bible. It is **nothing** more than the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). And it is through His death, burial, and resurrection that we are set free from the bondage of sin, cleansed and forgiven of all our sin, and have our place written in the Book of Life to live eternally with the Lord. But why is Jesus' death on the cross good news? And how does this save us?

## The Bad News
It starts with the bad news. Have you ever heard someone say, "*do you want the good news first or the bad news?*" Typically, with good news, there comes bad news along with it. This is certainly true in the case of the Gospel. The bad news, unfortunately, starts with you and me.

> <u>Romans 3:23</u>: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

We're all sinners. We all have sinned and are guilty of unrighteousness before a holy God (1 John 1:10). This sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2). And no matter how good you think you are; you cannot earn your way back into God's favor and be reconciled to Him through performing good deeds (Isaiah 64:6, Romans 4:4, Psalm 14:3, Psalm 53:3, and Romans 3:11-18). But this is just the start, the bad news continues even further. There are very real and very serious consequences for our sin, namely death and an eternity separated from God in hell. Romans 5:12 mentions that by "*one man's sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so, death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned*." Our sin causes physical death, and one day, we will be cast into hell as a result of our sin (Revelation 20:14-15). If this sounds grim, it's because it is. We are hopeless and helpless since we all have sinned. We are all going to die one day and split hell wide open... but we don't have to.

## The Good News
> <u>Romans 5:8</u>: But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Jesus made a way for us to be reconciled back to God, to be forgiven, to be saved from sin, and to receive everlasting life. Jesus, the Son of God, came down from heaven as God in the flesh, lived a perfect life (Hebrews 4:15 and 1 Peter 2:22) and made it possible for you and me to be saved by His death (Philippians 2:8), burial, and resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:17). Through His death, He became the propitiation (1st John 4:10) by shedding His blood (Romans 3:25) on the cross. Through His burial, He proved a literal, physical death. And through His resurrection, He conquered death (Revelation 1:17-18 and Acts 2:24) and made it possible for us to die to sin and live to God (Romans 6:9-11). He loved you so much that He bore your sins (1 Peter 2:24) and made it possible to be reconciled back to God (Colossians 1:21-22).  

But the news gets even better. Through Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, your sins can be forgiven (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, and Colossians 2:13), remembered no more (Psalm 103:12), and nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14). And it's so simple.

## How to Be Saved
### Repent
> <u>Mark 1:15</u>: And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

Repent, translated from the Greek word "[metanoeō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3340/kjv/tr/0-1/)" means to "change one's mind." We must first repent, or change our mind, before we believe. You just heard the clear Gospel presented to you. The next logical step is to change your mind and believe it. Repentance happens through seeing the bad news; our sinful condition before God as we saw just a moment ago. You're a sinner in need of a Savior and on your way to hell without trusting in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection.

### Believe
> <u>John 3:16</u>: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Salvation is by God's grace through our faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8-9). It has nothing to do with our good works or any other effort in which we try to obtain by our own accord (Romans 4:4-5, Titus 3:5, and Galatians 2:16). We obtain salvation through faith, but more specifically by hearing of the gospel and placing our trust in Jesus Christ to save us (Ephesians 1:13-14, Galatians 3:2, Acts 15:7-9, and Romans 10:9-14).

### Guide to Salvation
1. Recognize you are a sinner
2. Understand the penalty for sin and your need of a Savior
3. Repent (change your mind) and believe the Gospel; trust in Jesus Christ alone to save you

## What Happens Next?
If, after hearing the Gospel you truly repented and placed your faith in Jesus Christ, you have been sealed with the Holy Spirit and are saved (Ephesians 1:13-14)! After salvation, we are called (1) to preach the Gospel (Mark 16:15), (2) to love one another (Matthew 22:36-40, Romans 13:8, Romans 13:10, Galatians 5:14, James 2:8, and 1 John 4:7-9), (3) to obedience (2 Thessalonians 1:8, John 14:15, 1 Peter 1:13-14, and 2 Corinthians 2:9), (4) to live a changed life (Titus 2:11-14, 2 Corinthians 5:17, Ephesians 4:22-24, Ephesians 5:15-17, and Colossians 3:9-10), and (5) to be careful to maintain good works (Titus 3:8 and Ephesians 2:10). 

Please understand, you might slip, trip, stumble, and fall in your walk with Jesus. And if you do sin, we have an advocate (1 John 2:1), Jesus Christ, to confess your sins to (1 John 1:9). But you are not to use this as an excuse to sin (Romans 6:1-2 and John 8:34-35) or for an occasion to the flesh (Galatians 5:13). You are different if you truly repented and truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. You must put off the old self and put on the new self (Ephesians 4:22-24, Colossians 3:8-10, and 1 Peter 1:14). You have the Holy Spirit of God residing in you as a believer (1 Corinthians 6:19-20), so you [must live a changed life](https://www.exagora.me/christianity/changed-life/) as born-again believers (1 Corinthians 15:34 and 1 Peter 2:24-25). But this shouldn't be viewed as burdensome, because since Jesus died for us, we should want to live for Him (Galatians 2:20)!  

## Conclusion
We all have sinned and come short of God’s glory. And there are very serious consequences to that sin: death and an eternity separated from God in hell. This bad news seems grim, but in a lot of cases, good news comes with the bad. The good news is that Jesus came as God in the flesh to make it possible for us to be reconciled to God, to save us from our sin and hell, and to make a way for those sins to be forgiven. Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again to make all this possible for us. And all we need to do to accept that gift of salvation, is to hear the Gospel (Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection), repent (change your mind) and believe/trust in Christ to save you.

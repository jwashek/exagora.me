## What is the Gospel?
> <u>1 Corinthians 15:1-4</u>:<br>
> **1** Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; <br>
> **2** By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. <br>
> **3** For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; <br>
> **4** And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures

The Gospel is very clear according to the Bible. It is **nothing** more than the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's it. I thought it sufficient for the first post on this blog to be about the Gospel, because without it, we cannot be saved. Jesus said in [Mark 16:15b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+16%3A15&version=KJV) to *go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature*. Jesus didn't die to pay our sin debt in full for no one to hear about it. Imagine you bought a gift for your child and hid it away in the closet. If you left it in the closet and never told your child about the gift, then how will they know you ever bought it for themm in the first place? Just the same, the Gospel brings the free gift [(Ephesians 2:8-9)]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=KJV) of salvation for *all the world*; they just need to know about it.

## What Does It Mean?
The Gospel means `glad tidings` or `good news`. But why would Jesus’ suffering on the Cross and dying a horrible, painful death *ever* be labeled as good news? Well, you must understand a few things in order to fully grasp why the Gospel is nothing short of good news and everything more than good news!

### The Bad News
Have you ever heard someone say, "do you want the good news first or the bad news?" Typically with good news, there comes bad news along with it. This is certainly true in the case of the Gospel. The bad news starts with us. Every single person on this earth except for the Lord Jesus Christ has sinned [(Hebrews 4:15)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A15&version=KJV).

> <u>Romans 3:23</u>: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Knowing this comes the next part of the bad news. There are very real and serious consequences for our sin, namely death and hell. [Romans 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A12&version=KJV) mentions that by "*one man's sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned*." We inherited this nature from birth. We all will die physically at one point. If we die without believing and trusting in Jesus Christ, we will then die a second death--spiritually--and spend an eternity separated from Him in hell. 

> <u>Romans 6:23</u>: For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
> <u>2 Thessalonians 1:8:</u> In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ<br>
> <u>John 8:24</u>: I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.<br>
> <u>Revelation 21:8</u>: But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>
> <u>Revelation 20:14-15</u>:<br> 
> **14** And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.<br>
> **15** And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Sounds awful, right? That's because it is. We are hopeless and helpless since we all have sinned. But this is where the good news come into play!

### The Good News
> <u>Romans 5:8</u>: But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Some of the most beautiful verses in the Bible are often said to follow a "but." In the case of the above verse, this couldn't be truer! Jesus died for us to pay a debt He didn't owe that all might be saved through Him by belief--and He did this for us while we were *yet sinners*. How is that not good news? He suffered horribly on the Cross to satisfy a debt we could never pay. He became the propitiation [(1 John 4:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A10&version=KJV) for us and nailed our sin to the Cross [(Colossians 2:13-14)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A13-14&version=KJV)! 

It is free from good works on our part [(Titus 3:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+3%3A5&version=KJV). We are justified through faith without the deeds of the Law, or another way of putting it would be we do not need to keep the Law [(Romans 3:28)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A28&version=KJV) in order to become saved. That in and of itself is amazing news because no one was able to keep the Law [(Acts 15:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A10&version=KJV).


## How to Be Saved
The Bible is very clear on the Gospel as you saw. What else the Bible is very clear on is how to be saved. Now that you've heard the Gospel, have you changed your mind to believe it to be true? 

### Repent

> <u>Mark 1:15</u>: And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

Repent, translated from the Greek word "[metanoeō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3340/kjv/tr/0-1/)" means to "change one's mind." We must first repent, or change our mind, before we believe. Logically this makes sense because how can we believe something new if we're never told about it?

Think of it another way. If you don't believe you need saved, you'll never go to a Savior. Just as Jesus said in [Mark 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A17&version=KJV) that "*they that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick*." If you don't believe you're sick, you'll never change your mind and go to the doctor. Repentance happens through seeing our condition before God and realizing our sickness through sin has very real consequences if gone unchecked. This is when we turn to Him, the Great Physician, by faith and simply believe in Him to heal us.

### Believe
> <u>John 3:16</u>: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

It's that simple. Yet, this is so difficult for people to understand because they think, "what do *I* need to do?" Most people apply their own self-righteous efforts into salvation instead of fully trusting in Jesus. It’s **nothing** that we can do on our end—it is purely apart from good works [(Galatians 3:2)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A2&version=KJV) that we receive the Holy Spirit, which is evidence of salvation in and of itself that is presented through "fruit" in a believer's life [(Galatians 5:22-23)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+5%3A22-23&version=KJV). Besides all this, God sees *all of our righteousness is as filthy rags* like [Isaiah 64:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A6&version=KJV) states. You might ask, "Okay, I get it, believe. But **what** am I supposed to believe?" Paul writes to the Church at Ephesus:

> <u>Ephesians 1:13</u>: In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise

Notice several things here. If we walk the verse back, we can see what we are to beleive. Additionally, consecutive steps are presented in how we receive the Holy Spirit--the evidence of true salvation--which we receive **only** through belief [(John 7:39)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207%3A39&version=KJV):

**1st**: we hear the word of truth (i.e., the Gospel)<br>
**2nd**: we believe it and trust in Christ (i.e., the *whom* the verse is referencing back to)<br>
**3rd**: we are *sealed* with the Holy Spirit

That's it. It all points back to `believe`, but notice what we believe is very important. Believe the Gospel, the good news; the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If you believe this and place your trust in Jesus Christ to save you, the Bible is clear that you are saved. Not by some prayer, not by works (starting good works or stopping bad works); only through Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross are we saved through our faith in Him. Now that you've heard the Gospel, are you placing your faith in Jesus Christ to save you?

# Intro
We all experience trying times in our lives--some more than others. This is an unfortunate truth in the lives of both believers and unbelievers. What separates us, though, is how we react and respond to those trying times. Believers and unbelievers alike find common ground here. You might be surprised to know that believers, too, tend to push away from God as they feel abandoned when things go wrong. Whether it's the loss of a loved one, a seemingly insurmountable health diagnosis, financial worries, or a broken marriage, we all embark on these deeply traumatic experiences at various points in our lives. So how can we--knowing that we'll endure trials and tribulations--ensure that we react and respond in a way that makes us stronger and more resilient during future challenging times?

## Faith
As a Christian, I know a thing or two about faith. I don't mean this in a way to sound prideful; what I do mean is it's the basis of our salvation, sanctification, and every aspect of the life for the believer. I thought my faith was unshakeable. Now, **that** was prideful. And boy was my faith tested over the last decade (May 2014 - present). 

**Early Years of Marriage** <br>
I'll start this section with a story of my wife and I's experience shortly after we got married. 

Around late-May of 2014, just a few months shy of our 1-year anniversary, my wife and I were enjoying a weekend out in Swansboro, North Carolina. Everything was normal and we had a really nice weekend there--that is, until the very next day. I woke up that Sunday morning and was getting ready to go to Church. My wife complained about feeling sick and like she had the flu. I told her I would run to the store and grab her some medicine on my home from Church. This was all normal to me; she's been sick before. Or so I thought. 

When I got back home from Church, she was sitting on the couch and slumped over in a very unnatural position. Panicking, I asked if she was okay. Like the person she was, she brushed it off and just said she was dizzy and that, "it's just the flu." At this point, I noticed she was jaundice, and this wasn't any normal sickness. After fighting her to let me take her to the ER for what seemed like hours, she reluctantly agreed. She nearly fell in my arms in a severely weakened and fragile state. If panic-mode wasn't fully engaged yet, it sure was now.

After getting her to the ER, and after drawing labs, the doctors came in and told us something we certainly were never expecting: "We have no idea what's happening. Your liver numbers are extremely elevated and there's nothing we can do. We're going to have to transfer you to a different hospital." Thank you, military hospitals... After about a 2-hour drive to Greenville, North Carolina, we arrived very late, very tired, and very scared. I remember praying in the car as I was following the ambulance and not even really knowing what to pray for. 

Almost two weeks of being in the hospital, after countless tests, and after many sleepless nights, we had our answer: PSC. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis. Or, in non-medical terms, an auto-immune disease where the body attacks the bile ducts in the liver which causes cirrhosis and a slew of other symptoms--to which she had probably every one of them. 

Fast-forward several weeks later, we were told by her Hepatologist that within 5-10 years, she would need a liver transplant. A... what? A liver transplant? This hit us like a ton of bricks. Here we were, a freshly married couple that just started their lives together and we were hit with news that no one wants to hear. 

Not even 9 months later, the Hepatologist was off on his assessment by 4-9 years. This wasn’t happening. She was declining horribly and rapidly over those months until one of her best friends, Maddie, from our High School (we were High School sweethearts) offered to become a live donor. Sparing the full details here, all went well and my wife had her transplant on my birthday. So, in a way, we always shared a birthday after that. My physical birth and her new liver’s birth.

I tell you this story to share what got us through—both as individual Christians and in our marriage together. That was simply our faith. Our faith in Jesus. Never did we lean on Him more in our lives. It drew us *so* much closer together and to God. We did this through never wavering in our belief and trust that God would pull us through, praying without ceasing, and giving thanks to God.

> <u>1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</u>:<br>
> **16** Rejoice evermore.<br>
> **17** Pray without ceasing.<br>
> **18** In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

**Same Story, Different Issue** <br>
For about 5-6 years, my wife and I enjoyed our married lives together with only slight hiccups in her health after her transplant. We were finally happy again! We were in a new routine with her medications and the do’s and don’ts of post-liver transplant living were something that my wife was becoming a champion at. We just became parents! A lot of great changes were happening, and we were thrilled to see what God had in store for us. We were over the moon because things were just feeling normal again. That is, until July 2021. 

After complaining about being itchy again (the first real symptom that presented itself in my wife all those years ago that eventually led to her liver transplant) and receiving some not-so-good labs with elevated liver numbers, the immediate response from her Transplant Team was, “It’s probably just a blockage in your intestine somewhere, let’s get a scan and check it out.” We both should have known our lives wouldn’t have allowed it to be that easy. 

In a way they were right. It *was* a blockage. Although, the blockage was due to a large tumor and not just a standard blockage. It was then that we heard the most dreadful words that I’m convinced anyone can ever hear: “It’s cancer.” Now if the transplant news hit us like a ton of bricks, this news utterly destroyed us. And that it did. But it was *okay* because we were told (and this is almost word-for-word, mind you): 
* “If you could choose what type of cancer to get, it’s this”
* “This is highly treatable”
* “I promise I won’t let you die” (from her direct Oncologist)

Remember the Hepatologist and how wrong his assumption was before? Well, same story; different issue. I’ll spare the major details and just say: after countless trips to the hospital, 5 failed treatments, 2 bouts of sepsis, and an unspeakable amount of stress, my wife finally went to be with the Lord. Yes, she passed away in June of 2022. Not a full year after her diagnosis. My wife was gone. My wife *is* gone.

My wife had her faith truly shaken and stirred over those 11 months of battling her heart out, but she never lost faith in the Lord. I saw her at her absolute worst, and one thing that gets me through her loss is seeing how resilient her faith was. She questioned God, don’t get me wrong, but she `never` lost her faith and that is why I will *always* be inspired by her. I remember just about 2 months after she passed, I found a journal she kept. She **still**, after her diagnosis and through it all, wrote about God, thanking God, writing prayers to God; thanked Him for our daughter, salvation, and other things she held dear to her heart that God had blessed her with in her journal entries.

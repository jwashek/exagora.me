# Intro
We all experience trying times in our lives--some more than others. This is an unfortunate truth in the lives of both believers and unbelievers. What separates us, though, is how we react and respond to those trying times. Believers and unbelievers alike find common ground here. You might be surprised to know that believers, too, tend to push away from God as they feel abandoned when things go wrong. Whether it's the loss of a loved one, a seemingly insurmountable health diagnosis, financial worries, or a broken marriage, we all embark on these deeply traumatic experiences at various points in our lives. So how can we--knowing that we'll endure trials and tribulations--ensure that we react and respond in a way that makes us stronger and more resilient during future challenging times?

## Faith
As a Christian, I know a thing or two about faith. I don't mean this in a way to sound prideful; what I do mean is it's the basis of our salvation, sanctification, and every aspect of the life for the believer. I thought my faith was unshakeable. Now, that was prideful. And boy was this tested over the last year (July 2021 - present).

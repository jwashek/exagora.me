# Intro
On my way home from the grocery store just this morning, I heard a very concerning description of how to be saved from Greg Laurie of [Harvest Ministries](https://harvest.org/). At the end of his message, he stated something to the effect of, "If you want to be saved, pray this prayer after me: *Dear Lord, I am a sinner. I turn from my sins right now and turn to You. I believe in You as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for saving me. Amen*." How effective is this for saving one's soul? Since I don't believe in click-bait blog posts, or posts that you must read lengthy walls of text just to find your answer, let me be clear: this is **not** going to save you. There is too much to unpack here for the scope of this post, therefore, we'll keep it succinct and to the point of dealing with the heresy of the prayer itself.

## Why Is It Dangerous?
**Lacking Acknowledgement of Sin**<br>
For starters, there is no leading the sinner to acknowledge their sinful behavior. Jesus said in [Matthew 9:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A12&version=KJV), "*they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick*." If a person doesn't think they're sick, or worse, if they're in denial that they're sick, they will never go to the doctor. Just the same, a lost sinner won't recognize their need for a savior unless they become guilty before God as [Romans 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=KJV) states. How can *anyone* become "guilty before God" and recognize their sin in that prayer? They can’t; it's just not found. A sinner needs to know that [all have sinned](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=KJV), including them. A sinner needs to know there is a [penalty for sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=KJV). 

**Lacking of The Gospel**<br>
Lastly and certainly most important, a sinner needs to know the [Gospel]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A1-4&version=KJV), the good news, that Jesus died for us while we were [yet sinners]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A8&version=KJV). 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 teaches us very plainly the Gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Paul says to the Corinthian believers at the Church of Corinth that the Gospel is two things:

1. *wherein ye stand*
2. *by which also ye are saved*

Assuming this is true, how do you explain just simply praying a prayer is on-par with the Gospel? Do we stand in our prayer? Are we saved by our prayer? Certainly not. We are saved by God’s grace through faith and faith alone in the Gospel. 

**Lacking of Repentance**<br>
The Bible says in [Mark 1:15]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201%3A15&version=KJV) to “*repent and believe the gospel*.” In order to believe the Gospel, one must first show repentance--or a change of mind. If you don’t change your mind about your position with God, i.e., recognizing you’re a sinner, you will certainly never truly believe and subsequently, never be saved. This points back to the analogy of *they that be whole need not a physician*. You **must** first recognize your need for a savior! Since most evangelicals that follow this method of salvation, easy-prayerism, tend to quote Romans 10:13 and say, “See! `Call` means to pray!”, let’s break this down as well. This is actually simple because the problem with this thinking is found in the very next verse, which ironically is never mentioned by them. 

> <u>Romans 10:14:</u>  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

We cannot “call”, or pray, if we haven’t believed in Him first. We can’t believe in Him if we never heard the Gospel. We can’t hear the Gospel if we are presented with it. 
 
## The Tax Collector and the Publican
> <u>Luke 18:9-14:</u><br>
> **9** And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<br>
**10** Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.<br>
**11** The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <br>
**12** I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. <br>
**13** And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. <br>
**14** I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

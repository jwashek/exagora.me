## Intro
[Origen of Alexandria](https://iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) mentioned the crucifixion as *mors turpissima*, or "most vile death." There is very good reason for this, but maybe even this description doesn't do it justice. Most think that it might be painful to have nails driven into your hands and feet, being hung on a cross only to die after hours of intense agony, but it's so much more than this. "*Crucifixion*", by Martin Hengel is a fantastic book that explores the ins and outs of the crucifixion--from a historical perspective to a religious perspective--and was the inspiration to this post. If you are a believer and want to better appreciate Jesus for willingly dying this horrific death on the Cross, then I hope this post will be a blessing to you. If you are an atheist and don't believe the significance of His suffering through being crucified, I pray this post will open your mind and heart to be receptive to believe in Him.


## A History of Crucifixion
xyz
### Different Cultures
Persians did this, Romans did that... etc
### How Was Crucifixion Viewed?
> <u>1 Corinthians 1:23</u>: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness

The Jews saw the cross as highly offensive, where the Greeks saw the cross as something foolish to even consider. "*How can a god be a god if they suffer such a vile death?*"

Most people wouldn't even speak of it. A lot of early Christian theologians purposefully avoided the subject because of how heavy it was... definitely find a way to reword this.

## *Mors Turpissima*
### Before the Crucifixion
#### Flogging and Torture
they were flogged and tortured

#### Humiliation
Stripped naked, mocked, etc

#### "Carrying Your Cross"
they had to carry their own cross. Being extremely fatigued to bear the weight of the cross was suffering in and of itself. 

#### Intricate Nail Placement
A lot of thought went into the placement of the nails. It has been understood that even if the nails were 1 inch off, they would not be able to hold the weight of the individual hanging on the cross. This was highly calculated. 


### During the Crucifixion
#### Immense Suffering
The pain and suffering was immense

#### Pain with Every Breath
Every breath hurt

### After the Crucifixion
#### A Dishonor to the Dead
They lacked a proper burial

#### More Humiliation
their bodies were left to dogs, birds; they were lit on fire to serve as lamps by night

## TL;DR
The "Sinner's Prayer" is one of the largest heresies within Christianity. In short, the Sinner's Prayer is a quick evangelism tactic used by most evangelicals within Western Christianity after preaching the Gospel to see people saved. A sample prayer using this methodology could be seen as:

> "Dear Lord Jesus, I admit that I am a sinner and ask You to forgive me of all my sins. I believe that You died and rose from the dead to pay for my sins. I invite You into my heart. Thank You for saving me."

The problems with the Sinner's Prayer are there is no true acknowledgement of sin, no true repentance, it's extremely novel (originating ~1945 AD), and this method is an absolute 180 from the preaching of the ancient church and early apostolic Christianity.  

## Why Is It Dangerous?
At best, a sinner might acknowledge their sinful behavior by being run through the "[Roman's Road of Salvation](https://www.logos.com/grow/nook-romans-road-salvation/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Romans%20Road,Jesus's%20free%20offer%20of%20salvation)". At worst, a sinner might be asked, *do you know if you were to die today if you would be in heaven or in hell?* There's problems in both of these views. The problem with the former is that a false sense of security is given to the sinner with the prayer being the object of their faith ("*I'm good, I prayed the Sinner's Prayer!*"). No matter what they do; no matter how they live, they're sealed by the iron doors brought on by the Sinner's Prayer. The problem with the latter is pushing fear to manipulate and mold an ideology, then forcefully injecting it into someone. This almost never lasts--about as long until the fear wears off, then the sinner is back to their old ways or at least until a hardship where they fall away from the faith entirely (Matthew 13:3-9).

### Lacking Acknowledgement of Sin
Never mind the fact that the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 9:12, "*those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick*." If a person doesn't know they're sick, or worse, if they're in denial that they're sick, they will never go to the doctor. Just the same, a lost sinner won't recognize their need for a Savior unless they become guilty before God (Romans 3:19). At least the "Roman's Road" does some justice to this, in showing that a person *is* a sinner and there's a penalty for their sin; however, just having someone repeat "*I'm a sinner*" or "*I acknowledge my sin*" does nothing to show them the truth about their sin and, in turn, will do nothing in truly changing one's mind to better things. In other words, they are much less likely to show true repentance.

### Lacking Repentance
When our Lord Jesus sent out the Twelve Apostles (Mark 6:7-11), the main focus of their preaching was that the people should repent (Mark 6:12). And this is fitting since the Lord Jesus did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Luke 5:32). He also said if we don't repent, we will *all* likewise perish (Luke 13:3). Repentance is obviously necessary for true conversion, so why does the Sinner's Pray neglect it almost altogether?

At its core, repentance means a "change of mind" (Greek verb: [metanoeō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3340/kjv/tr/0-1/)). If you don't change your mind about your position with God (i.e., recognizing you're a sinner), you will never truly believe and subsequently, you will never fear God or amend your ways.

> "But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man's salvation." -- Tertullian (160-240 AD), [On Repentance](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian20.html)

The Sinner's Pray completely nullifies the necessity of repentance--it just poses a surface-level change of mind with no accompanying "fruit worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8)." What exactly is this fruit worthy of repentance? This is the same question that the people asked John the Baptist when he preached that message to the people (Luke 3:10). And we see what true fruit is, as John answers this question directly:

* Being compassionate to those in need (Luke 3:11)
* Acting honesty and with integrity (Luke 3:13)
* Showing justice and kindness (Luke 3:14)
* Refraining from greed or covetousness (Luke 3:14c)

We see this in action in yet another place, where our Lord Jesus mentioned that the men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah (Luke 11:32). When Jonah preached to the Ninevites, they repented, believed (Jonah 3:5), cried mightily out to God and turned from their evil (Jonah 3:8-10). This is true repentance since it has the fruit worthy of repentance.

### Lacking Historical Backing
Early Christians, especially that in the apostolic era (from the death of the Lord Jesus (~33 AD) to the death of the last apostle (~100 AD)), made no mention of a Sinner's Prayer when they presented the Gospel. There is *zero* historical support for this evangelism tactic, not only in the Ante-Nicene era (from the death of the Lord Jesus until 325 AD), but throughout *all* church history until the mid-20th century--which we'll get into in just a bit. Why is this important? First, it's novel. Extremely novel--especially considering the 1,900 years of church history where the Sinner's Prayer wasn't ever recorded. Second, what the apostles preached was what they learned directly from the Lord--so are we to trust their word or a preacher's word nearly 2,000 years removed from the Cross? 

In speaking of the apostolic tradition, Hippolytus--who was a disciple of Irenaeus, who was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of the apostle John himself--says the following:

> "They shall be instructed to pray and kneel with them. They shall be instructed to be sober in all things, and to honor the widow, and to visit the sick. If they give alms, or show acts of mercy, they shall do so in simplicity. They shall fast and pray before the day on which they are baptized. And whatever they are able to do well, they should do. For it is a calling of life and death. For if there is any grace in the water, it is not because of the water, but because of the Holy Spirit. For the water is received by prayer and by the descent of the Holy Spirit, as the one being baptized enters in faith and repentance of sins, by the instruction of those who oversee him." -- Hippolytus of Rome (170-235 AD), The Apostolic Tradition, Chapter 20

The early church took to the apostle Peter's words to "repent and be baptized" (Acts 2:38) very seriously. This was how they preached. Not "pray this prayer," but rather, they preached the Lord Jesus, His death and resurrection, how the prophecies spoke of the Lord Jesus, and then how to align oneself with this message: repentance, faith, and baptism--not a 5-second prayer. Look how Hippolytus showed that, before baptism, "fruit worthy of repentance" was instructed:

* Be sober in all things
* Honor the widow
* Visit the sick
* Give alms and show acts of mercy
* Fasting and prayer

Justin Martyr reflects a similar tradition received from the apostles here:

> "And for this rite **we have learned from the apostles** this reason...and may obtain in the water the remission of sins formerly committed, there is pronounced over him who chooses to be born again, **and has repented of his sins**, the name of God the Father and Lord of the universe; he who leads to the laver the person that is to be washed calling him by this name alone (emphasis added)." -- Justin Martyr (100-165 AD), First Apology, Chapter 61

Notice how the early church places baptism *after* repentance, just like in the New Testament. Which we see all throughout Scripture: a person hears the Gospel, they repent and believe, and they are baptized. Not: a person hears the Gospel, then they pray a prayer. 

## The Origin of the Sinner's Prayer
So, where did the Sinner's Prayer originate? Dr. Paul Chitwood, in his [theological dissertation](http://digital.library.sbts.edu/bitstream/handle/10392/4153/Chitwood-PhD-SinnersPrayer.pdf?sequence=1) from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary found that the Sinner's Prayer didn't appear well into the 20th Century--not until around 1945 in fact. It wasn't until several years later that this evangelistic method started to become more mainstream and popularized by none other than Billy Graham. Interestingly, Dr. Paul Chitwood also found in his research that no gospel tracts, which often are reliable indicators of the preaching of earlier time periods, did not include *any* mention of prayer until, as mentioned already, the 1940s. You must ask yourself: "*if the Sinner's Prayer is something we should use as a tactic for salvation or evangelism, why were no evidence of this prayer found until the 20th Century?*"

## Intro
[Origen of Alexandria](https://iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) mentioned the crucifixion as *mors turpissima*, or "most vile death." There is very good reason for this, but maybe this description doesn't even do it justice. Most think that it might be painful to have nails driven into your hands and feet, being hung on a cross only to die after hours of intense agony, but it's so much more than this. "*Crucifixion*", by Martin Hengel is a fantastic book that explores the ins and outs of the crucifixion--from a historical perspective to a religious perspective--and was the inspiration to this post. If you are a believer and want to better appreciate Jesus for willingly dying this horrific death on the Cross, then I attempt to summarize the major points in this post for you. If you are an atheist and don't believe the significance of His suffering through being crucified, I pray this post will open your mind and heart to be receptive to believe in Him.

## Intro
[Origen of Alexandria](https://iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) mentioned the crucifixion as *mors turpissima*, or "most vile death." There is very good reason for this, but maybe even this description doesn't do it justice. Most think that it might be painful to have nails driven into your hands and feet, being hung on a cross only to die after hours of intense agony, but it's so much more than this. "*Crucifixion*", by Martin Hengel is a fantastic book that explores the ins and outs of the crucifixion--from a historical perspective to a religious perspective--and was the inspiration to this post. If you are a believer and want to better appreciate Jesus for willingly dying this horrific death on the Cross, then I hope this post will be a blessing to you. If you are an atheist and don't believe the significance of His suffering through being crucified, I pray this post will open your mind and heart to be receptive to believe in Him.


## A History of Crucifixion
There are few detailed ancient descriptions of crucifixion. Most ancient descriptions don't go into much detail, seemingly due to the nature of the topic--it's very uncomfortable and speaks of horrific suffering. However, as Martin Hengel points out on page 25 of "*Crucifixion*", it's the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible that possibly present the most detail. Strangely enough because crucifixion was very widespread in ancient Rome leading up to Jesus' death on the Cross, so one would assume more historical artifacts would have at least been revealed over time.

### Different Cultures
Though the Romans were arguably the most notable proponents of crucifixion, it was far more reaching than just Rome. Ancient Persians and Carthaginians, and maybe more surprisingly, Grecians also used this dreadful form of capital punishment. The styles of crucifixion between cultures varied greatly—from how the crucifixion was carried out, to whom it was carried out upon--but typically this variableness was found in *who* would be crucified. For example, the Romans crucified lower class citizens such as slaves, violent criminals, and thieves far more commonly than those of a higher class. And they usually performed the crucifixion at the place that the crime occurred. Conversely, the Persians and Carthaginians imposed crucifixion primarily on high officials and commanders. Along similar lines, Jews usually only crucified those found to be guilty of high treason.<br><br>
**So, Why Crucifixion?**<br>
It is often believed that the real reason for crucifixion was to be that of a deterrent, much like death by hanging. Most crucifixions regardless of culture were almost exclusively public for this reason. But some would argue it fulfills the human's primal nature for seeking revenge for crime and wrongdoing--just in an excruciatingly gruesome manner. 

### How Was Crucifixion Viewed?
> <u>1 Corinthians 1:23</u>: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness

The Jews saw the cross as highly offensive, something they rarely discussed between themselves or with others. Whereas the Greeks saw the cross as something foolish to even consider. "*How can a god be a god if they suffer such a vile death?*" The Greeks typically mocked Christians in this manner. And, somewhat surprisingly, the Jews held to a common belief as the Greeks according to [Deuteronomy 21:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A22-23&version=KJV) which states that if a sinner is hung on a tree, they are accursed of God. Therefore most Jews do not hold to teaching that Jesus was the true Messiah because the Messiah would have to be accursed if he hung from a tree like the Lord Jesus Christ did. Interestingly enough, Paul addresses this in [Galatians 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A13&version=KJV) by saying that *Christ became a curse for us*. It was intended for the Messiah to address our curse of sin through this manner.

More generally, most people wouldn't even speak of crucifixion in ancient times. A lot of early Christian theologians purposefully avoided the subject because of how heavy it was. This is rather odd considering Jesus’ death on the Cross is a pivotal part of the Christian faith; He didn’t just die, He suffered horribly on the Cross and shed His literal, physical blood for our redemption.

## *Mors Turpissima*
### Before the Crucifixion
**Flogging and Torture**<br>
If the act of crucifixion wasn’t enough, there was a lot of prep-work that went into it before the hanging on the crucifix. The biggest preparation was that of flogging. [Flogging]( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flog) is the act of repeatedly whipping with a stick or a whip. The Romans used this technique with a minor difference. They would add sharp bones at the end of the stick or whip to ensure they would rip into and tear apart the flesh. Flogging was typically done on the back but could be anywhere the stick or whip would strike. Blood would often pour profusely after just several strikes, but what’s possibly more relentless is the fact that Romans did not have a set number of times they would whip their victim. If you could imagine, many would die during the process of flogging alone. It was extremely common for the victims to be already dead before hanging on the cross—due to the flogging or other means of torture. 

The Romans were often more brutal in their forms of torture in addition to the flogging (as if flogging wasn’t enough punishment already). One such method was to burn their victims’ eyes out of their sockets while their family watched. Often, too, they would kill family members of the victim and force them to watch. Possibly most cruel, it was reported that Antiochus IV would strangle the victim's children and hang them around their neck as they were crucified [[1]](https://www.livescience.com/65283-crucifixion-history.html#:~:text=In%20Rome%2C%20people%20condemned%20to,and%20legs%20by%20Roman%20soldiers.). 

**Humiliation**<br>
Now that the flogging and torture had completed, the victims of crucifixion were stripped naked and mocked. Crucifixion was not just a death sentence to the body, but almost to every aspect of the human life. Not only were the victims, if they survived to this point, suffering an almost unimaginable amount, now they had to suffer further embarrassment through being naked and mocked by their own people. 

**"Carrying the Cross"**<br>
Crucifixion victims had to carry their own cross. Bearing this weight on an already-fatigued body reduced to raw flesh was punishment in and of itself. The victims would then have to carry the cross to the place they were to be crucified. Every step causing the weight to crash down on sore, painful, open wounds. In addition to the tremendous amount of pain, this coupled as another form of humiliation to an already awfully battered victim.  

### During the Crucifixion
**Intricate Nail Placement**<br>
A lot of thought went into the placement of the nails. It has been understood that even if the nails were a few inches off on the wrist, the hands would not be able to hold the weight of the individual hanging on the cross and the nails would eventually rip entirely through their hands. There is some evidence that suggests the nails were placed at the tip of where the radius and ulna meet, at the very bottom of the wrist. This way, the weight is not bearing on the small bones in the hand, but the bigger, stronger bones in the arms. 

For the nails in the feet, the intricacy doesn't consider the placement so much as the reasoning behind it. Not all cultures placed nails in the feet, but the Romans typically did. When a victim is hanging on the cross, they have to push up with their legs in order to get a full breath. When their feet are nailed, it makes it much more challenging to do so, which is why many victims would die of suffocation since they couldn't exhale excess carbon dioxide, or even catch a full inhale to begin with.

**Pain with Every Breath**<br>
With the nails in the feet already causing it hard to breath for crucifixion victims, the flogging imposed prior would certainly make this challenge much more unattainable. With every breath, their back would expand causing their raw, exposed flesh to press up against the hard wood, only becoming further splintered and scraped in the process. Breathing then becomes a chore and might feel similar to a slow drowning of sorts. The idea is the same, the victim knows they have to breathe, but they're preventing themselves from doing so--or something else is preventing them from doing so. Even if the lack of nails or pain would allow for a full breath, the victim was no doubt suffering from severe fatigue which further added to labored breathing.

### After the Crucifixion
Even after all the pain, suffering, and humility a victim would endure through crucifixion, the punishment hardly stopped there. Victims were rarely buried. Their bodies would be left hanging for food to wild animals and birds. Some cultures covered the bodies in wild animal skin and allowed their bodies to be fully torn apart by dogs. Bodies were even lit ablaze to serve as lamps by night. In any case, the crucifixion typically didn't end in the victim's death. Rather, their true end was to have their lifeless bodies further defiled and dishonored in numerous, merciless ways.

## Conclusion
### Summary
Crucifixion was a cruel and excruciating punishment for unfortunate victims. Every aspect of human suffering seemed to be present in crucifixion from utter humiliation to immeasurable agony. Cultures that carried this ultimate form of punishment onto their victims were heartless and ruthless in their styles. Most proponents for crucifixion implemented torture, whereas almost all implemented flogging. No doubt, every preparation prior to the actual crucifixion from flogging to the nail placement was highly calculated, the purpose only serving to prolong or deepen the suffering. Sadly, the torture did not stop after death since the bodies were desecrated further by allowing wild animals to eat their flesh or even using their bodies as lamps by lighting them on fire. Crucifixion was truly *mors turpissima*. 

### To Believers
If you are like me, I always understood Jesus suffered on the Cross. That goes without saying... What I never considered, though, was just how horrific the process of crucifixion was for Him. And it wasn't until reading "*Crucifixion*" that I could appreciate Jesus' sacrifice on a much deeper level. Truly this is something I'll never forget and I'm thankful to God for leading me to read this book--even if it was highly disturbing at times. Understanding the suffering Jesus endured from every angle is something that we as believers can never fully appreciate or ever repay. That's exactly why He did what He did. This was only a debt that He could remove from our accounts. He redeemed us in the most agonizing, awful, and barbaric way possible. For that, I will never lose my faith or trust in Him. I just pray I am always reminded of the love He showed us--not for dying, but the way He knew He had to. 

### To Unbelievers
I attempted to use very little Bible verses and approach this from a more historical level. Almost all claims made here were referenced in the "*Crucifixion*" book, which had hundreds of sources; therefore, it would be near impossible to source every claim made here. I only say that to show the historical significance of crucifixion and Jesus' death thereby. Since most atheists errantly disbelieve in Jesus' existence, there are many highly educated atheist scholars that don't hold to this thought:

* Gerd Ludemann, "*The Resurrection of Christ, Pg 50.*"
> “Jesus' death as a consequence of crucifixion is indisputable.” 

* Michael Martin, “*Skeptical Perspectives on Jesus’ Resurrection, Pg 285.*"
> “Some skeptics have maintained that the best account of the biblical and historical evidence is the theory that Jesus never existed; that is, that Jesus’ existence is a myth (Well 1999). Such a view is controversial and not widely held even by anti-Christian thinkers.”

* Bart Ehrman, "*The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, Pg 276*":
> “It is a historical fact that some of Jesus’ followers came to believe that he had been raised from the dead soon after his execution. We know some of these believers by name; one of them, the apostle Paul, claims quite plainly to have seen Jesus alive after his death. Thus, for the historian, Christianity begins after the death of Jesus, not with the resurrection itself, but with the belief in the resurrection.”

If even these scholars believe Jesus (a) did exist, (b) died through crucifixion, and (c) understand the historical evidence supporting the claims to Jesus' resurrection, then how can this still be argued today? Furthermore, if this can be proven historically, Jesus willingly died through unimaginable suffering and agony to pay for the sins of the whole world, including yours! Claiming this free gift of salvation through His death is as simple as recognizing your sinful condition before God, believing the [Gospel](https://www.exagora.me/salvation/gospel/what-is-the-gospel/) (i.e., the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus) and trusting in Jesus Christ to save you.

## Intro
Many Christians today don't have the assurance of salvation. This is an all-too-common struggle that a lot, if not all, Christians experience at one point or another in their walk with the Lord. The reasons can range from sin to becoming spiritually stagnant, but the lack of assurance doesn't have to last! As Christians, we can defeat the doubt when it creeps in with the Word of God and we can rest easy knowing the facts. So next time you struggle with assurance, examine yourself with the Word of God [(2 Corinthians 13:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=KJV) and trust Jesus' work was **finished** on the Cross at Calvary. And always remember that word `trust`, since doubt is always opposed to trust. But for now, let's dig a little deeper and equip ourselves to better address this problem we all mostly likely face, will face, or have faced.

## Why Do We Lose Assurance?
### Sin
Maybe not surprisingly, the first reason we lose assurance as believers is sin. Sin in the sense of actual, current sin in our lives or even with past sins that we, in our own minds, cannot overcome. You know, sins that you committed and ask, "*would a **real** Christian have struggled with this?*" We tend to invalidate our position with God because of the sin in our lives. Past and present, sin can grab ahold of us and sink its fang, deeply rooting itself anywhere it pleases. We can even be taken down that path of destruction we once claimed our part in through recollection of our old ways. Our sins of the past can make us lose assurance possibly because we forgot our sins were forgiven and purged? Our sins of the present can make us lose assurance possibly because we abuse His grace and ignore the conviction? Don't turn your back on conviction when you feel it enter your life. Take the discipline and chastisement [(Hebrews 12:8)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012%3A8&version=KJV) in stride. Apply what God is instructing you and learn from it. This can come by way of conviction, which isn't all that bad, though, because conviction is something used by the Holy Spirit to draw us nearer to God. Use the conviction to your advantage and pray that God will show you any sins you need to deal with to restore your fellowship with Him. Overcome your sin and regain your assurance by trusting in the Lord!

### Trusting Ourselves
Trusting in ourselves and our own self-righteousness (i.e., good works) will cause us to doubt our salvation possibly quicker than sin itself does--and for good reason. Some Christians when they are first born-again almost find it hard to believe that Jesus saved them. It is for this reason that they tend to recall past sins, "*God can't forgive **that** sin...*" or think they need to work towards salvation, "*Faith seems too easy, I need to do **something** to repay Him!*" It is in those moments that we fail to trust in Him fully and we shift that trust upon ourselves. Remember, salvation is a free gift [(Ephesians 2:8-9)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=KJV). Working is achieving. Salvation is receiving. You cannot achieve a gift that is free. All you need to do is receive it. Even then, logically let's think about it... how many good works should we do; is there a set number? What if we missed an opportunity to do something good? If we sin, do we need to counter that with two good works? Remember, Isaiah said *all our righteousness is as filthy rags* [(Isaiah 64:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A6&version=KJV). **Nothing** you do can put you in good standing with God except for your faith in Jesus Christ. It is His righteousness, not our own. Trusting in our works are nothing but feeble attempts to regain assurance that we most likely lost in the same manner to begin with. To put it a different way, if we lost our assurance by trusting in ourselves, how can we regain that assurance by trusting in ourselves?

There is a phenomenal book written by Andrew Murray called [*Abide In Christ*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Abide_in_Christ/KvgaAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) that I read very recently. In one of the chapters, it was stated that, since we are saved by faith and faith alone, why do we reason with ourselves that we also aren't sanctified through faith? Trusting, resting, and relying solely on Jesus Christ in **all** aspects of our Christian walk is the target we need to aim for. Trust in the Lord in all things [(Proverbs 3:5-6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203%3A5-6&version=KJV)! Paul summed it up rather well with a question he posed in his epistle to the Church at Galatia:

> <u>Galatians 3:2</u> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

We received the Holy Spirit not by anything *we* did, have done, or will do, but only through faith and our trust in Jesus Christ. Let's put off our efforts and put on His effort. Overcome your self-righteousness and regain your assurance by trusting in His righteousness, not your own!

### Spiritual Stagnation
You may have heard the saying, "*if you're not progressing, you're regressing*." It seems Peter taught this very thing regarding our faith. In his 2nd letter, Peter states: 

> <u>2 Peter 1:5-9:</u><br>
> **5** And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br>
> **6** And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br>
> **7** And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br>
> **8** For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
> **9** But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

If we are not growing in the Lord, Peter says we can become barren and unfruitful; we can become blind and we can even forget Christ has **purged** our sins from us. All this certainly leading to doubting our salvation or having a lack of assurance. Overcome the spiritual stagnation and regain your assurance by growing your faith in Jesus Christ!

## Blood Sacrifice
I thought it necessary to briefly explain how sacrifices worked in the Old Testament and how this differed from the New Testament. This will be an important lead-in to the next major section. Having a high-level understanding of how sacrifices worked will only make us better understand our position with God as it relates to assurance... so why not, right? 

### Out With the Old
The holy of holies (or Most Holy Place) was the inner sanctuary within the [Tabernacle](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/what-does-the-tabernacle-symbolize/), which was essentially a tented palace where the high priest would offer sacrifices to God. Inside the Tabernacle, and just before the Most Holy Place, there was a separation by a large veil. Behind this veil--and within the Most Holy Place itself--is where the ark of the covenant resided. Within the ark was the mercy seat (hopefully you're still with me). Now, each year during the [Day of Atonement](https://www.gotquestions.org/Day-Atonement-Yom-Kippur.html), the high priest had to enter the Most Holy Place and sprinkle the blood of sacrificed bulls and goats upon the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the high priest as well as for the people of Israel.

> <u>Leviticus 16:14-16</u><br>
> **14** And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.<br>
> **15** Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:<br>
> **16** And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

### In With the New
Alright, we now understand how sin was atoned for (a possibly better word to use is `covered`, and this will be important later) in the Old Testament, let's see how it was done in the New Testament. Though, a blood sacrifice was still required [(Hebrews 9:22)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+9%3A22&version=KJV), it was by *His own blood* [(Hebrews 9:12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A12&version=KJV) that this atonement was made for us. "*His*" obviously referring to the Lord Jesus Christ. This atonement was made for the sins of the entire world [(1 John 2:2)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202%3A2&version=KJV), but the best part? Jesus was the picture of Old Testament sacrifice as He came as a high priest [(Hebrews 9:11)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+9%3A11&version=KJV) and by His own blood, he obtained eternal redemption for us [(Hebrews 9:12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+9%3A12&version=KJV)! This means that our sin is no longer covered, but `removed` and is cast as far as the east is from the west [(Psalm 103:12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20103%3A12&version=KJV). What a beautiful truth that is, right? Assuring in every sense of the word.

### An Analogy to Better Understand
Consider the difference of atonement between the Old Testament and the New Testament with an analogy. Imagine you're driving down a main road near your home. There's a large pothole across the entire road and cars have been getting damaged as they drive over it. Workers come by and cover the pothole so now the cars can safely move over the pothole without getting damaged. But over time, the cars continue beating down on the patched road which causes it to sink through. Now the pothole is recreated and is just as bad as it was before. This process is repeated every year since the county only has enough budget to cover the pothole. One day, a Worker comes by and tells the county that he can fix the pothole if they just trust in him to do so. The process is long and painful for the Worker, as he had to tear apart the road and reconstruct it, but now the pothole is no longer covered, it's removed entirely! The county didn't pay a single dime as the Worker paid it all. Since the road is brand new, the cars can travel with assurance knowing they will no longer be damaged by the pothole. 

The picture of assurance from the analogy that I want to direct your attention to is that of the Worker. If we place ourselves in the shoes of the county, our budget never would have accounted for the amount to cover the complete remodel of the road to address the pothole. It wasn't until the Worker came and completed the project by his own hands that we see our new position. How can we then, as the county, work by throwing money into a pothole that no longer exists? We can't, the pothole is gone! We can feel as though we didn't deserve it at times, but the fact remains: our problem has been addressed completely.

## Facts Over Feelings
Feelings are something that comes and goes. Look at your own life. What feelings do you have right now? More than likely, these feelings you're experiencing in this moment will differ from the feelings you'll experience even tomorrow. You have good days and bad; days when you're happy and days when you're sad (I had no intention of that to rhyme, but apparently, I missed my calling as a poet... ). Our feelings cannot be depended upon, and we cannot predict what our feelings will bring the very next day. So why do we base our assurance on mere feelings and not trusting in God's promises? If we believe the Bible as we claim we do, then God's promises are facts. So, let's examine some of these facts through God's Word:

* Our debt of sin we owed was **canceled** and applied to Jesus, being nailed to the Cross [(Colossians 2:14)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A14&version=ESV). 
* Once we believe the Gospel and trust in Jesus, we are **sealed** with the Holy Spirit [(Ephesians 1:13)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+1%3A13&version=KJV).
  * That seal then becomes our down payment, or assurance, until the day of redemption [(Ephesians 1:14)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+1%3A14&version=KJV).
> __Note__: Ephesians 1:13-14 used directly above could be an **entire** post in and of itself. One thing to note about this passage is found in the word `sealed`. The Greek word ["sphragizō"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4972/kjv/tr/0-1/), used here to translate "sealed", is interesting because one of the translations can be that of, "*to confirm authenticate, place beyond doubt*." Did you catch that? God seals us; we are marked and are placed beyond doubt that we are His! If the seal is *beyond doubt*, then why do we doubt the seal? If that wasn't enough for you, consider [Revelation 5:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+5%3A1-5&version=KJV) where no man or angel was able to open God's 7 seals on the scroll except for Jesus Himself! You are sealed by God, no one can break that seal.
* If we believe in Him, we **have**--this is written in the present tense--everlasting life [(John 6:47)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+6%3A47&version=KJV).
* God wants us to know that we have eternal life [(1 John 5:13)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A13&version=KJV).

All those facts were presented just to say, "take God at His Word." Salvation isn't some formula or a special checklist we must etch our mark into the boxes, but it's a Person! Our salvation never resided in us, and no more does our assurance. They both reside in Christ! Let's take God at His Word, trusting in His promises instead of something we do, have done, or will do.

## Just-If-I'd
I'm not sure who coined the play-on-words as this section's heading says, but I don't think anything describes being justified more accurately than *just-if-I'd*. That is, Jesus' work on the Cross and our faith and trust in Him makes it *just-if-I'd* never sinned! And rightfully so, because being justified is not something we use our own self-righteousness to achieve, no, it's something Someone else has done. To be declared justified is to have His righteousness applied to our account. Uh-oh, time for another analogy!

Imagine you owe a debt and are sent to a judge to receive your sentence. The judge orders you to pay a fine, but this fine is well outside of your means. In other words, you likely wouldn't be able to repay this debt in 10 lifetimes, let alone this one. Just before you receive your sentence, someone comes to the judge and pays your debt in full. This person redeemed you by taking your debt onto themself fully and freely. In the eyes of the judge, you are now absolved and justified. 

Oftentimes, people use `justified` and `redeemed` interchangeably, however, they're vastly different words with vastly different meanings. But using them that way isn't inherently incorrect though. If we're justified, we've been redeemed; if we're redeemed, we've been justified. The doctrine of justification is one that that we should always circle back to if we're losing assurance or doubting our salvation. And the same applies to the doctrine of redemption.

## Redeemed, Redeemed!
The word `redeem` as rendered in [Galatians 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+3%3A13&version=KJV) comes from the Greek word ["exagorazō"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1805/kjv/tr/0-1/).

> __Note:__ Bonus points if you caught that the Greek word used in this verse is the same word inspired by the name of this blog! If not... shame on you (just kidding)

Why is this important? Well, this word is particularly interesting. If we break it down further, we get two root words:

1. ["ek"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1537/kjv/tr/0-1/) meaning, "out of, from, by, away from"; and
2. ["agorazō"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g59/kjv/tr/0-1/) meaning, "to be in the marketplace, to attend it; to do business there, buy or sell"

Therefore, we get a new meaning by breaking down exagorazō to imply, "*out of the marketplace*." This meaning paints a beautiful picture for redemption as I'll show in just a moment, so bear with me. In the 1st century AD, slavery was very common and used for just about anything you could think of by the Romans. Where they would do a lot of slave trading was in marketplaces. In some cases, slaves were redeemed by being purchased and set free, directly within the marketplace. So, "out of the marketplace" is how they found their redemption. Makes sense, right? Paul used this imagery to describe precisely how we are redeemed as sinners. We were all slaves to sin [(Romans 6:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A6&version=KJV). Our Savior redeemed us and bought us with a price [(1 Corinthians 7:23)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207%3A23&version=KJV), freeing us to no longer be slaves to sin. What better way to realize assurance than to see we no longer are slaves to sin but are free and redeemed by His grace through our faith in Christ!

## Conclusion
Assurance may come and go in the life of a believer. Next time doubt creeps in, let us examine ourselves and apply God's promises, trusting in Him to ensure it goes as quickly as it came. Losing assurance or doubting our salvation can present itself through sin in our lives, lack of trust in God, becoming spiritually stagnant, or because we're basing our assurance on feeling rather than facts from the Word of God. We are justified and we are redeemed! Once we trust God fully with all things relating to our walk with Him, we are better equipped to defeat these doubts since doubt is the opposite of trust. Like our sin being nailed to the Cross, let's nail all our doubts there as well by being fully reliant and trusting in the finished work of Christ.

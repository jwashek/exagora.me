## Intro
Many Christians today don't have the assurance of salvation. This is an all-too-common struggle that a lot, if not all, Christians experience at one point or another in their walk with the Lord. The reasons can range from sin to becoming spiritually stagnant, but the lack of assurance doesn't have to last! As Christians, we can defeat the doubt when it creeps in with the Word of God and we can rest easy knowing the facts. So next time you struggle with assurance, examine yourself with the Word of God (2nd Corinthians 13:5) and trust Jesus' work was **finished** on the Cross at Calvary. And always remember that word `trust`, since doubt is always opposed to trust. But for now, let's dig a little deeper and equip ourselves to better address this problem we all mostly likely face, will face, or have faced.

## Why Do We Lose Assurance?
### Sin
Maybe not surprisingly, the first reason we lose assurance as believers is sin. Sin in the sense of unrepentant, current, unconfessed sin in our lives or even with past sins that we, in our own minds, cannot overcome. You know, sins that you committed and ask, "*would a **real** Christian struggle with this?*" We tend to invalidate our position with God because of the sin in our lives. And rightfully so. Sin is serious and has very serious consequences. Past and present, sin can grab ahold of us and sink its fang, deeply rooting itself anywhere it pleases. When you find sin in your life, immediately repent and confess that before God. Take the discipline and chastisement (Hebrews 12:8) in stride. Apply what God is instructing you and learn from it. Repent, confess your sin, and God will forgive you and help you to overcome it. Don't allow sin to entangle you and be overcome by it (2nd Peter 2:20-21). Remember, those that commit sin are slaves to sin (John 8:34). We are not to let sin reign in us (Romans 6:12), but are commanded to depart from it (1st John 2:1, 1st Corinthians 15:34, and 2nd Timothy 2:19)!

### Trusting Ourselves
Some Christians, when they are first born-again, almost find it hard to believe that Jesus saved them. It is for this reason that they tend to recall past sins, "*God can't forgive **that** sin...*" or think they need to work towards salvation, "*Faith seems too easy, I need to do **something** to repay Him!*" It is in those moments that we fail to trust in Him fully and we shift that trust upon ourselves. Remember, salvation is a free gift (Ephesians 2:8-9). Working is achieving. Salvation is receiving. Paul said that we received the Holy Spirit by faith:

> <u>Galatians 3:2</u> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

### Lack of Fruit or Works
True faith **will** produce fruit and works (James 2:20). But we aren't trusting in these works for our justification, these are proof of true faith. Have you changed? Are you abiding in Christ (John 15:5)? Are you obedient to Christ (James 1:22 and John 14:15)? Do you claim to love the Lord but deny Him by your actions or inactions (1st John 4:20, 1st John 4:7-9, 1st John 3:18, and Titus 1:16)? Do you show the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)? 

> <u>Galatians 5:22-23</u>:<br>
> **22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,<br>
> **23** Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law

### Spiritual Stagnation
You may have heard the saying, "*if you're not progressing, you're regressing*." It seems Peter taught this very thing regarding our faith. In his 2nd letter, Peter states: 

> <u>2nd Peter 1:5-9:</u><br>
> **5** And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br>
> **6** And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br>
> **7** And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br>
> **8** For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
> **9** But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

If we are not growing in the Lord, Peter says we can become barren and unfruitful; we can become blind and we can even forget Christ has **purged** our sins from us. All this certainly leading to doubting our salvation or having a lack of assurance. Overcome the spiritual stagnation and regain your assurance by growing your faith in Jesus Christ!

## Blood Sacrifice
I thought it necessary to briefly explain how sacrifices worked in the Old Testament and how this differed from the New Testament. This will be an important lead-in to the next major section. Having a high-level understanding of how sacrifices worked will only make us better understand our position with God as it relates to assurance.

### Out With the Old
The holy of holies (or Most Holy Place) was the inner sanctuary within the [Tabernacle](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/what-does-the-tabernacle-symbolize/), which was essentially a tented palace where the high priest would offer sacrifices to God. Inside the Tabernacle, and just before the Most Holy Place, there was a separation by a large veil. Behind this veil--and within the Most Holy Place itself--is where the ark of the covenant resided. Within the ark was the mercy seat (hopefully you're still with me). Now, each year during the [Day of Atonement](https://www.gotquestions.org/Day-Atonement-Yom-Kippur.html), the high priest had to enter the Most Holy Place and sprinkle the blood of sacrificed bulls and goats upon the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the high priest as well as for the people of Israel.

> <u>Leviticus 16:14-16</u><br>
> **14** And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.<br>
> **15** Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:<br>
> **16** And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

### In With the New
Alright, we now understand how sin was atoned for (a possibly better word to use is `covered`, and this will be important later) in the Old Testament, let's see how it was done in the New Testament. Though, a blood sacrifice was still required (Hebrews 9:22), it was by *His own blood* (Hebrews 9:12) that this atonement was made for us. "*His*" obviously referring to the Lord Jesus Christ. This atonement was made for the sins of the entire world (1st John 2:2), but the best part? Jesus was the picture of Old Testament sacrifice as He came as a high priest (Hebrews 9:11) and by His own blood, he obtained eternal redemption for us (Hebrews 9:12)! This means that our sin is no longer covered, but `removed` and is cast as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). What a beautiful truth that is, right? Assuring in every sense of the word.

## Facts Over Feelings
Feelings are something that come and go. Look at your own life. What feelings do you have right now? More than likely, these feelings you're experiencing in this moment will differ from the feelings you'll experience even tomorrow. You have good days and bad; days when you're happy and days when you're sad (I had no intention of that to rhyme, but apparently, I missed my calling as a poet... ). Our feelings cannot be depended upon, and we cannot predict what our feelings will bring the very next day. So why do we base our assurance on mere feelings and not trusting in God's promises? If we believe the Bible as we claim we do, then God's promises are facts and His Spirit testifies with our spirit that we're the children of God (Romans 8:16). So, let's examine some of these facts through God's Word:

* Our sin was **canceled** and applied to Jesus, being nailed to the Cross (Colossians 2:14). 
* Once we believe the Gospel and trust in Jesus, we are **sealed** with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13).
  * That seal then becomes our down payment, or assurance, until the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:14).
> __Note__: Ephesians 1:13-14 used directly above could be an **entire** post in and of itself. One thing to note about this passage is found in the word `sealed`. The Greek word ["sphragiz≈ç"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4972/kjv/tr/0-1/), used here to translate "sealed", is interesting because one of the translations can be that of, "*to confirm authenticate, place beyond doubt*." Did you catch that? God seals us; we are marked and are placed beyond doubt that we are His! If the seal is *beyond doubt*, then why do we doubt the seal? If that wasn't enough for you, consider Revelation 5:1-5 where no man or angel was able to open God's 7 seals on the scroll except for Jesus Himself!
* If we believe in Him, we **have**--this is written in the present tense--everlasting life (John 6:47).
* God wants us to know that we have eternal life (1st John 5:13).
* Once we believe, we have been passed from death unto life (John 5:24).

All those facts were presented just to say, "take God at His Word." Salvation isn't some formula or a special checklist we must etch our mark into the boxes, but it's a Person! Our salvation never resided in us, and no more does our assurance. They both reside in Christ! Let's take God at His Word, trusting in His promises instead of something we do, have done, or will do.

## Redeemed, Redeemed!
The word `redeem` as rendered in Galatians 3:13 comes from the Greek word ["exagoraz≈ç"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1805/kjv/tr/0-1/).

> __Note:__ Bonus points if you caught that the Greek word used in this verse is the same word inspired by the name of this blog!

Why is this important? Well, this word is particularly interesting. If we break it down further, we get two root words:

1. ["ek"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1537/kjv/tr/0-1/) meaning, "out of, from, by, away from"; and
2. ["agoraz≈ç"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g59/kjv/tr/0-1/) meaning, "to be in the marketplace, to attend it; to do business there, buy or sell"

Therefore, we get a new meaning by breaking down exagoraz≈ç to imply, "*out of the marketplace*." This meaning paints a beautiful picture for redemption. In the 1st century AD, slavery was very common and used for just about anything you could think of by the Romans. Where they would do a lot of slave trading was in marketplaces. Slaves were redeemed by being purchased and sent off with new owners, directly within the marketplace. So, "out of the marketplace" is how they found their redemption. Makes sense, right? Paul used this imagery to describe precisely how we are redeemed as sinners. We were all slaves to sin (Romans 6:6). Our Savior redeemed us and bought us with a price (1st Corinthians 7:23), freeing us to no longer be slaves to sin. What better way to realize assurance than to see we no longer are slaves to sin but are free and redeemed by His grace through our faith in Christ!

## Conclusion
Assurance may come and go in the life of a believer. Next time doubt creeps in, let us examine ourselves and apply God's promises, trusting in Him to ensure it goes as quickly as it came. Losing assurance or doubting our salvation can present itself through sin in our lives, lack of trust in God, becoming spiritually stagnant, or because we're basing our assurance on feeling rather than facts from the Word of God. We are justified and we are redeemed! Once we trust God fully with all things relating to our walk with Him, we are better equipped to defeat these doubts since doubt is the opposite of trust. Like our sin being nailed to the Cross, let's nail all our doubts there as well by being fully reliant and trusting in the finished work of Christ.

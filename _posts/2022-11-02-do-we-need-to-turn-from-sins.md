## Intro
I recently wrote an article about the dangerous and unbiblical doctrine of the [Sinner's Pray](https://www.exagora.me/heresy/a-dangerous-prayer/). What inspired me to write that article was partly the same inspiration for this post. Greg Laurie--in the prayer that he claims we need to pray in order to be saved--said, "*...I turn from my sins right now and turn to You...*." Sadly, he's not the only preacher teaching this nonsense. There are countless others, but this post will focus solely on another preacher: Ray Comfort. Now, there are differences in *when* preachers teach you need to turn (i.e., as a requirement for salvation or as a requirement after salvation), so our main focus will be, "*do I need to turn from sin before having faith in Jesus?*" I wanted the main focus of this post to surround the idea of turning from sin **before** we place our faith in Jesus; a prerequisite to belief of sorts. We will examine this school of thought and point out the errors by using Scripture as well as basic logic supported by Scripture. 

### Quick Disclaimer:
In no way am I attempting to pick on Bible teachers here. However, as [Romans 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+16%3A17&version=KJV) mentions, we are to "*mark and avoid*" those that cause divisions contrary to the doctrine which we have received. Additionally, [Galatians 1:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+1%3A8-9&version=KJV) clearly teaches that anything other than what Paul preached pertaining to the Gospel, is a false gospel. Paul never mentioned turning from sin before we have belief in the Gospel that he received [(1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 15:1-4)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A1-4&version=KJV) as a requirement for salvation. Therefore, we can conclude that slapping a pre-requisite of turning from sin as a requirement for salvation is a false gospel.

## Turning From Sin
### Is It Required?
Ray Comfort errantly teaches we must turn from sin to become saved. In the below video from [3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAEcmkjL4w&t=187s) to [3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAEcmkjL4w&t=195s), Ray describes that "*repentance is an old-fashioned word that means to confess and forsake your sins.*" Earlier in the video he said we must *first* repent and *then* we can have faith. Therefore, it's crucial to understand what "repentance" means, especially in the sense that Ray defines it, because we cannot have faith unless we repent. 

> __Note:__ We will get into what repentance means later, but in no way is biblical repentance what Ray teaches above.

Ironically, Ray and his team flip-flop their stance on their Living Waters podcast about [*What Is Repentance?*](https://livingwaters.com/what-is-repentance). If you listen at the 5:24 mark, it was mentioned that repentance is "a change of mind," to which the Bible would agree. But if you continue to listen from that moment, they complain that people confuse what the Living Waters ministry thinks on repentance... well, can you blame them? What is it? Is repentance a "change of mind" or is it "confessing and forsaking your sins?" Because they’re providing wildly different responses to the same question. The reason why so many people confuse Ray Comfort's and Living Waters' stance on repentance is because they themselves are confused.

If that wasn't enough, listen to Ray's very [disturbing answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu3-Eku79h0&t=220s) on how we become saved. He said:

> "There are two things you have to do to be saved. 
> 1. First, you must repent... turn from all sin and live in holiness... and
> 2. trust alone in Jesus."

Let me ask you this, do you see what he did there? He placed salvation on our shoulders by requiring us to turn from sin and live in holiness before we ever place our trust in Jesus. How can we live in holiness, set apart for God, if we never believe in Him to begin with? Ray has it completely backwards and is confusing sanctification with salvation. Why is Jesus and our faith in Him an afterthought to our works? We trust in ourselves first to rid ourselves of sin (which is impossible as [1<sup>st</sup> John 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A8&version=KJV) says, by the way), then and only then do we have faith in Jesus? We first have **faith**, then we are told to put off our former ways and depart from iniquity ([Ephesians 4:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204%3A22&version=ESV) & [2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 2:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202%3A19&version=ESV)). Never does the Bible mention we turn from sin *before* we get saved. How could we? We haven't trusted Christ yet; how can we have victory over sin if He hadn't saved us from our sins yet? You can't walk in the Spirit and *not* fulfill the lusts of the flesh if you never received the Spirit through faith ([Galatians 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A16&version=ESV) & [Galatians 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A2&version=ESV)). What about [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=KJV)? [Acts 16:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016%3A31&version=KJV)? [Acts 10:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010%3A43&version=KJV)? What about the thief on the cross? He had no time to turn from all his sin. The list goes on, but the idea remains, it is through faith alone and nothing that we can do by our own accord [(Ephesians 2:8-9)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=KJV). If you are trusting in Ray's method to get saved without first believing/trusting in Christ, let me be clear: you will die in your sins [(John 8:24)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A24&version=ESV) and be headed to Hell attempting to save yourself before you ever trust in Jesus for salvation. 

## What is Repentance?
The Bible uses the Greek word ["metanoia"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3341/kjv/tr/0-1/) for repentance, which simply means, "a change of mind." You're changing your mind in what you're trusting in. You repent **towards** God, like [Acts 20:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020%3A21&version=KJV) mentions, and have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, let's just replace the word `repent` in that verse with both Ray Comfort's description of repentance and the Bible's description of repentance.

| Ray's Teaching  | The Bible's Teaching  |
|---|---|
| "Turning from all your sin and living in holiness" towards God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ  | "a change of mind" towards God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ  |

You see the difference? Remember the thief on the cross I mentioned earlier? Let me ask you this, "do you think the thief on the cross changed his mind or turned from all sin?" The thief showed a biblical repentance in changing his mind toward God by defending Jesus and having faith in Him! The thief even showed works by rebuking the other thief! This is important because Jesus said, "today you shall be with me in paradise [(Luke 23:39-43)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23%3A39-43&version=KJV)." This is one of the few cases we can know most assuredly that someone went to heaven.

> __Note:__ I think it's important to mention here that if you truly change your mind (repent) and place your faith in Jesus, your faith **will** have action. You will want to serve Him, you will want to abide in Christ, you will want to turn from sin, you will love others, you will want to obey Him, and you will feel convicted of sin in your life because you have the Holy Spirit residing in you; you are a new creature [(2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 5:17)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A17&version=KJV). A true repentant heart toward God will bring about fruit in the believer's life [(Galatians 5:22-23)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A22-23&version=KJV).

## A Further Examination
### What is Sin? 
If we are to understand what turning from sin means, we first must define `sin`. According to the Bible, sin is transgression of the Law [(1<sup>st</sup> John 3:4)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A4&version=KJV). When you break God's Law, you have sinned. When you sin, you break God's Law. This means the 10 Commandments; this means all the [613](https://evidenceforchristianity.org/how-many-of-the-613-laws-of-moses-apply-to-christians-how-do-i-know/) laws of Moses. Before you can have faith in Jesus (as Ray Comfort says) you need to turn from sin, so do you really expect to trust yourself to keep all those laws? A better question, do you even *know* what all those 613 laws are? We tend to think of sin as something we are to avoid morally, such as obvious things like murder or adultery. However, the Bible also teaches sin can be that of omission as well. [James 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A17&version=KJV) says that if we know to do good, but don’t do it, that in and of itself is sin. Did you ever drive by a homeless person and had a wad of cash in your hands (okay, maybe not a *wad*...), but kept it to yourself? The right thing would have been to give to the poor and needy, right ([1<sup>st</sup> John 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A17&version=ESV) & [Hebrews 13:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+13%3A16&version=ESV))? Can you turn from something you don’t even realize you’re doing until the Holy Spirit reveals this to you? 

Let’s look a little deeper by using the Greek. The Greek word used to translate sin, ["hamartia"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g266/kjv/tr/0-1/), is almost always translated to that of "*to miss the mark*." This directly aligns with 1<sup>st</sup> John 3:4's definition of sin, because if we do not keep God's Law, we clearly missed the mark. Think of it like archery. The Law is our mark, or target, and we aim our arrows to hit that target. And what happens when your arrow doesn't hit the target? You miss the mark! 

### Logical Errors
**Keeping the Law**<br>
If sin is transgression of the Law, wouldn't turning from sin mean that you're keeping the Law? Absolutely, it would! It's our work or His finished work. Since all our works are as filthy rags to God [(Isaiah 64:6)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+64%3A6&version=KJV), how can we trust in that before we trust in Him? The Law was used as our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ through faith, and once we had faith, we no longer had a need for the schoolmaster [(Galatians 3:24-25)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A24-25&version=KJV)! Here's just a few more verses to help us understand that faith precedes works, and not the other way around: 

* [Titus 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+3%3A5&version=KJV)
* [Romans 3:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A20&version=KJV)
* [Romans 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A28&version=KJV)
* [Galatians 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&version=KJV)
* [Galatians 2:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+2%3A21&version=KJV)
* [Galatians 5:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A4&version=KJV)
* [Romans 4:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204%3A4-5&version=KJV)

Galatians is mentioned in several verses above, but the entirety of Galatians is evidence against turning from sin or keeping the Mosaic Law to be saved. The context of Galatians is about Jews falling from the Gospel and turning back to the old way of keeping the Mosaic Law. It's sad to see that some 2,000 years later, the same issues are plaguing Christianity. One of my favorite verses in Galatians just so happens to be listed above, but it's that of [Galatians 2:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+2%3A21&version=KJV) which states:

> <u>Galatians 2:21</u>: I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.

We are nullifying Christ's death on the Cross--His sacrifice--if we are trusting in ourselves and our works by attempting to turn from sin prior to having faith in Him.

**Jerusalem Council**<br>
Acts 15 is another well-known response to this very question of keeping the Law. The story goes that some men came from Judaea and preached that Christians needed to be circumcised in order to be saved [(verse 1)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A1&version=KJV). Once Paul and Barnabas took this to the Jerusalem Council before the elders and apostles, several Pharisees added that, in addition to circumcision, believers needed to keep the Mosaic Law to be saved [(verse 5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A5&version=KJV). Peter then stood up and addressed this issue by saying that we hear the Gospel and believe and its God who gives us the Holy Spirit as a witness if our hearts truly believed [(verses 7-8)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A7-8&version=KJV). Peter ends by asking them why they are trying to place a burden on the necks of believers since they (the Jews) and their forefathers could not even bear to keep the Law [(verse 10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A10&version=KJV).

**Just How Many Sins?**<br>
Let's look back into Ray Comfort's belief. We need to turn from **all sin** as he suggests. How do we know we turned from all sin before we place our trust in Jesus? What about those sins of omission? Are we equipped as unbelievers with a bell that rings inside of us, telling us we're now ready to become a believer and trust in Christ? What if we sin 30 times a day, then cut it back to just sinning 2 times a day, are we ready to have faith now? How about if we sin once a year? It's utter absurdity to suggest we need to turn from sin before we can have faith in Jesus Christ--and I would also add that it's blasphemous to the work that Christ fulfilled on the Cross to take salvation on ourselves by trying to keep the Law.

**What About You and Me?**<br>
Do you sin? Of course, you do! In [1<sup>st</sup> John 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A8&version=ESV) the phrase, "*if we say we have no sin...*" is used. The Greek word for "have" in this context is ["echō "](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2192/kjv/tr/0-1/), which means "to have; to hold (in the hand); to possess." This is in the current, present tense that this is used. John even goes a step further and uses the past tense as well in verse 10:

> <u>1<sup>st</sup> John 1:10</u>: If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us

The difference between an unbeliever and a believer is not the flesh; we all have the flesh, but rather, it's the Spirit! Christians are constantly battling with the two natures; the flesh and the Spirit are at war with one another and cause us "*not to do the good things that we want to do*" [(Galatians 5:17)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A17&version=KJV). The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak [(Matthew 26:41)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A41&version=KJV). So how can we, knowing that we have the flesh residing in us, break free from the very thing that is causing us to sin? Jesus Christ! This war doesn't end once we become saved. That's when the war starts. 

## Conclusion
Many preachers teach a damnable heresy that we must turn from sin before we can have faith in Jesus Christ. Some, like Ray Comfort, teach that you must turn from all sin before having faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. Since sin is transgression of the Law, if we turn from sin, we effectively are keeping the Law, and thus trusting in our own self-righteous efforts before ever having faith to begin with. By using Scripture, we concluded that righteousness does not come from the Law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. All throughout Scripture, we see evidence that Christ fulfilled the Law as He was our living Sacrifice. He did not come to die on the Cross as our Savior so we can keep up with old traditions of keeping the Law, or else He would have died in vain. Stop trusting in yourselves and trust in the One who is worthy of our faith!

## Intro
Symbolism is one method that the Bible uses to convey complex ideas to the reader. Luckily for us, the Bible uses *lots* of symbology. Examples of this can be found all throughout the Old Testament, which typically are presented as a foreshadowing to Jesus in one form or another. Some of this symbology includes Jesus being referred to as physical objects such as a door, a ladder, or even a bronze serpent. You might be asking what in the world does any of that have to do with Jesus? Well, I guess that's what symbology is all about, right? We must examine things a little deeper to see what might be hidden in plain sight.

## Jesus Is...
### The Door
The days leading up to the flood were perilous to say the least. So much so that the entire world was slated to be destroyed due to their sin and rebellion. Noah and his family were spared from God's wrath as they found favor in His sight. Through their obedience to God's instruction for them to build the ark, they were saved from the flood--the ark was the only way. Though the other people of that time had ample opportunities to listen and get into the ark themselves (1st Peter 3:20), they loved their sin and lives too much to care, making a mockery of the situation. Once God shut the door to the ark, it was now too late for the people. All they had to do was enter through the door.

Just as the ark was the sole protection and salvation for Noah and his family, Jesus is our sole protection and salvation; He is our door: 

> <u>John 10:7-9:</u><br>
> **7** Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br>
> **8** All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.<br>
> **9** I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

And just as there was no other way in the days of Noah, Jesus is the only way for us now (John 14:6). We must enter in through the Door, just as they did through the door of the ark. 

### The Ladder
> <u>Genesis 28:12:</u> And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.

Jacob dreamed about a ladder where angels were ascending and descending to earth. This is symbolic of a bridge of sorts, bridging the gap from us to heaven. In John 1:51, Jesus equated Himself to being the ladder by saying, "*...angels of God ascending and descending **upon** the Son of man* (emphasis added)." It's remarkable how Jesus called Himself the very ladder that provides us an access point to God (1st Timothy 2:5), because that's exactly what He is. Many of these symbolic references are to salvation, and this one is no different. All we need to do is take the Ladder to reach heaven, our ultimate destination and salvation.

### The Bronze Serpent
> <u>John 3:14:</u> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up

Jesus likened Himself to being lifted up just as the serpent in the wilderness was. Jesus is calling back to the book of Numbers where the children of Israel were in the wilderness after being brought out of Egypt. They were discouraged because the way was difficult, so they began to question God and complained about not having good food or water. God then sent serpents to where the Israelites were getting bit and they were dying. After some time, the Israelites came to Moses and confessed their sins, asking that Moses pray to God to remove those serpents from them. Moses consulted with God, and He told Moses to make a serpent of brass and set it upon a pole. This way, if anyone was bitten, they simply looked at the bronze serpent and they were healed.

> <u>Numbers 21:4-9:</u><br>
> **4** And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<br>
> **5** And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.<br>
> **6** And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.<br>
> **7** Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.<br>
> **8** And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.<br>
> **9** And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

Much like the serpents in the wilderness, we all are bitten with sin and will suffer a second death if we do not look with faith to Jesus. I want to draw your attention to something very interesting in this passage. Notice how God instructed Moses to construct a fiery serpent--the very thing that was killing the Israelites. This symbology carries its weight all the way to the Cross. The very thing that is killing us, sin, is exactly what Jesus became so we might become righteous through our faith in Him (2nd Corinthians 5:21)--much like the serpents which were killing the Israelites. This symbolism is truly astounding in this passage and here's just a few more relations we can draw from it and apply to Jesus:

| Symbols in Numbers  | Symbols in Jesus  |
|---|---|
| the pole which the Bronze Serpent was set upon  | the Cross where Christ was crucified  |
| Bronze Serpent  | Jesus  |
| fiery serpents  | sin  |
| fiery serpent's bite  | the sting of death (1st Corinthians 15:56a)  |
| looking at the Bronze Serpent  | looking to Jesus (Hebrews 12:2)  |
| physical healing by faith in the Bronze Serpent | spiritual healing by faith in Jesus |

### The Scapegoat
> <u>Leviticus 16:7-8,21-22:</u><br>
> **7** And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>
> **8** And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.<br>
> **21** And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:<br>
> **22** And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

In the Old Testament, a scapegoat was used for the sins of the people by Aaron laying his hands on the goat, confessing all the sins of the people, then sending it away into the wilderness--effectively removing their sins. What I love about the Old Testament is how much foreshadowing there is just about everywhere you look. Everything seems to point back to Jesus. Just like the scapegoat in the Old Testament, Jesus became our Scapegoat. As the scapegoat was sent off in the wilderness, Jesus was mentioned to have "*suffered outside the gate*" (Hebrews 13:12), which was thought to be its own form of wilderness because it was outside of the city. And just as the scapegoat ran off with the Israelites' sins, God cast our sin as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12).  

### The Passover Lamb
The Passover was an event detailed in the book of Exodus where God struck down the first-born child of the Egyptians. This also happened to be the final plague that God spread against Pharoah because of him not letting the Israelites go out from captivity. Before the events of the Passover, though, a lamb was slain and the blood was applied across the doorposts of every household to which the death angel was to pass over. God stated that the blood would be a sign and when He saw the blood on the door (Exodus 12:13), the plague would not affect those which had the blood applied. This was how He differentiated the Egyptians by the Israelites. 

Often, the heart is seen as a door; something we can open to receive someone or shut to deny them (Revelation 3:20). And just as they applied literal blood to the doorposts for the death angel to pass over, we must apply Jesus' blood to our door--our heart--through faith in Him (Romans 3:25)! Jesus was the precious Lamb that was slain (1st Corinthians 5:7) for His blood to be applied to our account by faith in Him.

### The Grain of Wheat
Harvest time is when the wheat plant dies. It is cut off from its stock. The Bible often draws a comparison of being cut off to dying--more on this later, though. Now, if just one seed is planted from a wheat plant which has died, this single seed, given enough time, will fill an **entire** field and bring about a largely abundant harvest. Jesus even mentioned this exact scenario in John 12:23-24.

> <u>John 12:23-24:</u><br>
> **23** And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<br>
> **24** Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

When Jesus died on the Cross, He was "*cut off*" (Daniel 9:26). And when He was cut off (died) he was planted much like a seed in the soil (buried). Once He sprouted (resurrected), He produced many seeds much like a single grain of wheat would. Now, if that wasn't interesting enough, here's some even more fascinating symbolism. These many seeds produced from the main Seed were added just 50 days later during the Feast of Weeks. Why is this fascinating? The Feast of Weeks was in celebration of the first fruits of the wheat harvest. The day of Pentecost (which means "fifty") is when those seeds were added. The Holy Spirit was added upon these believers at Pentecost which became the very first-fruits of that Seed! Jesus was our grain of wheat to produce an abundant harvest of believers by sacrificing His life for us. 

## Conclusion
The Bible produces amazing symbolism to Jesus all throughout the Scriptures. This symbology can be expressed to help us better understand more complex ideas that it’s trying to present to us. Some of these symbolic references to Jesus include Him being referred to as a door--such as the door to Noah's ark; a ladder--such as Jacob's ladder where angels were ascending and descending from heaven; and a Bronze Serpent--such as how the book of Numbers presents the Israelites' salvation through their looking upon the Serpent. In any case, and even in those that weren't included here (for there are **many more** symbolic references not mentioned in this post) we can observe them to all have the same similarity: Jesus is referred to everywhere!

## TL;DR
Scripture tells us to examine ourselves whether we're in the faith. This infers that we can *not* be in the faith--which, in and of itself, should be words of feaful caution to us. Therefore, it's vitally important for us as believers to heed to this warning. Are we living as we ought and not justifying sinful behavior? Are we repenting and confessing our sin to the Lord? Are we living in accordance to the Lord's commandments? Christian living is characterized by a lifetime of faith, obedience, repentance, and love. 

## Examine Yourself
We are told to search the Scriptures (John 5:39) and to study to show ourselves approved (2 Timothy 2:15). We do this by being like the Bereans, searching whether what we hear from others is true and aligns with Scripture (Acts 17:10-11). So, when the apostle Paul tells us to examine ourselves (2 Corinthians 13:5) to test if we're in the faith or not, we do so by testing it against Scripture. And, luckily for us, there are several passages that prove helpful in our case of examination.

### Are You Living in Unrepentant Sin?
**2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 12-13**<br>
First off, let's start with the context of our passage to see why Paul told the Corinthian church to examine themselves in the first place. Paul starts his thought by saying he fears he will find the church in a less than desirable state (2 Corinthians 12:20), a state that will leave him mourning for their impenitance and unrepentant sin (2 Corinthians 12:21). The Corinthian church was seeking proof of Paul's apostleship (2 Corinthians 13:3), and after his credibility was put into question, he turns the request around on the Corinthians asking them to seek proof of their own standing in the faith (2 Corinthians 13:5). So, we see here that Paul presents this question to the Corinthians because they were seemingly rebuked for behavior unbecoming of a Christian, they got defensive, and questioned Paul's authority. Instead of heeding to his rebuke, they hypocritically asked for proof of Paul's validation as an apostle, yet they were living in unrepentant sin. We can start by examining ourselves with the following:

* "*How am I when someone disciplines or rebukes my behavior? Do I justify my behavior and continue living in it?*"
* "*Do I get defensive when confronted with sinful actions I've been partaking in?*"
* "*Am I living in unrepentant sin?*"

### Are You Obedient and Living Holy?
**1<sup>st</sup> John**<br>
The importance of the book of 1<sup>st</sup> John cannot be understated in our examining of our own faith. The apostle John tells us one of the main reasons he wrote the epistle, and it's so the readers might know they have eternal life (1 John 5:13).

What better place to examine ourself then, right? This epistle is short, but packed with content; content that helps us in examining our status in the faith. The main principles taught in this epistle that help with our examination include:

* (1) walking in the light (1 John 1:6-7), 
* (2) keeping His commandments (1 John 2:3-5), 
* (3) admitting your guilt and confessing your sins (1 John 1:9), 
* (4) decreasing sin's hold onto your life (1 John 3:5-6), 
* (5) loving others (1 John 3:14,23-24), 
* (6) living out your love with actions and not words (1 John 3:17-19), and 
* (7) separating yourself from the world (1 John 2:15). 

The beauty of John's epistle here is that it's very black-and-white in his using of statements such as, "*here's how we know we know Him...(1 John 2:3)*." John couldn't be more clear, and subsequently, it couldn't be more clear to us. So we must ask ourselves:

* "*Do I attempt to live right and walk in the light?*"
* "*Am I keeping His commandments and living in obedience?*"
* "*Do I admit and confess my sin before Him or do I make excuses for it?*"
* "*Am I putting sin to death?*"
* "*Do I love others and is my love showing itself through actions?*"
* "*Am I separating from the world, or do I love the things of the world?*"

### Do You Have Fruit of the Spirit?
Another solid means of examining whether we're in the faith can be that of inspecting the fruit of the Spirit in our own lives.

> <u>Galatians 5:22-23:</u><br>
> **22** But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br>
> **23** gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.

Be honest with yourself when examining the fruit. Ask yourself:

* "*Am I showing love to others?*"
* "*Do I see myself exercising self-control?*"
* "*Am I patient with others or am I short-tempered?*"
* "*Do I respond to people with gentleness, kindness, and goodness?*"

### Are You Doing His Will?
The Lord Jesus said that not all that say to Him, "Lord, Lord" will enter the kingdom, but he who does the will of His Father (Matthew 7:21-23). And, what a stark reminder that is for us to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12). We must always aim to do His will, but what exactly *is* the will of the Father?

* Believing in the Son (John 6:40)
* Repentance (2 Peter 3:9)
* Showing mercy (Hosea 6:6 and Luke 6:36)
* Abstaining from sexual immorality, lust, and impurity of the flesh (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5)
* Keeping His commandments (John 14:15, 1 John 2:3-4, and Ecclesiastes 12:13)
* Obedience (Matthew 21:28-31)
* Pursuing what is good; being thankful and showing gratitude (1 Thessalonians 5:14-18)
* Doing good to all (1 Peter 2:15)

In contrast to this, we could also say that doing God's will includes doing the *opposite* of Satan's will. Satan's will invovles sin (1 John 3:8) since he's been sinning since the beginning. If you're living a life of sin, you are living a life of lawnessness (1 John 3:4). And those who practice lawnessness are the very ones who will hear those dreaded words by our Lord Jesus: *Depart from Me* (Matthew 7:23)!

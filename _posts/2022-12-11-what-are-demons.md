## Intro
As Christians, we most likely have been taught to believe that demons are fallen angels. So, let's play "Ask a Christian" and see what a common response might be when asking the question of where demons came from. *Demons came from fallen angels. These fallen angels rebelled with Satan just before the fall of man in Genesis 3. Satan, as part of his rebellion, drew 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the angels with him. It was these angels that then became demons*. More than likely, this is the answer you'll receive if you ask most Christians; however, another might be that "*we just don't know*." But are these responses what the Bible teaches? Do we know what demons are and where they came from?

## Demons
### What They Are Not
First, I'd like to describe what demons are not. Demons are not physical beings. Demons are also not angels. Yes, this means that demons are not fallen angels like what is commonly taught by most evangelicals. If you study the entire Bible and even do a comprehensive search of "angels," "demons," or a combination of either one with "third" or "1/3<sup>rd</sup>," you will not find a *single* passage that teaches 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the angels defected before the fall of man. I know what you might be thinking. "*What about Revelation 12?*" 

> <u>Revelation 12:4,7,9</u><br>
> **4** And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.<br>
> **7** And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,<br>
> **9** And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him

Very often the above passage is what's used when teaching the origin of demons. If you look closely, though, it does appear that demons could have been created as a result of fallen angels because Satan "*drew the third part of the stars of heaven*". But look at that passage again. The context is important and is referring to a war in Heaven and devouring "*her child as soon as it was born*." This is in conjunction with the 1<sup>st</sup> coming of the Messiah and **not** referring to the garden of Eden when Satan caused Adam and Eve to sin--where Isaiah 14:12 would be a parallel passage in the same timeline. Now, that being the case, we must assume that demons would have had to have existed *before* the coming of Christ, right? If not, what do we do with passages like Deuteronomy 32:17? Or really any other Old Testament passage that details "devils," "demons," or "unclean/evil spirits." We see many other Old Testament passages referring to "devils" or "unclean spirits" much before Christ was born--but more on this later. Therefore, we must have *another* event that we can draw from to help us understand what demons are and where they originated since they clearly existed before the 1st coming of Jesus Christ.

### What They Are
Demons are disembodied spiritual beings often called "unclean spirits," "evil spirits," or even sometimes "devils." If this seems like a rather quick answer, it'll make much more sense when we get to explaining "*where demons came from*." We have many stories in the Bible where Jesus casts out demons such as when He cast out many demons into a herd of pigs (Luke 8:33). Also, the Pharisees on several occasions said that Jesus had an "unclean spirit," claiming that He was performing miracles by the power of demons. These sprits are clearly not physical beings in these stories, but they do have power to inhabit the physical--people, animals, or even objects. 

Have you ever considered in the Old Testament or other secular ancient writings where people would construct idols and worship them? These people knew these idols were made of wood, metal, clay, stone, or any other type of material, yet they still worshipped them. Why? The idea was never to build the object and worship the idol *itself*; no, they would build this object or idol as a spiritual *home* for an entity. These ancient people would then perform many ceremonies and rituals on these idols, one of the most common being the "opening of the mouth." Someone, you and me, who breathes is alive. These people captured this very idea, performed the ceremony of opening the idol's mouthâ€”which is symbolic to being alive and breathing--with the hope that an entity would attach itself to, or otherwise inhabit, the idol. We see a converse truth to this for believers with the Holy Spirit indwelling in our temple, i.e., body (1st Corinthians 6:19).

## Building a Foundation
### Peter and Jude
Let's lay some additional groundwork as it will become an important build-up later on. In 2nd Peter 2:4, we have Peter describing the following:

> <u>2nd Peter 2:4:</u> For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;

Let's keep two things in mind here as we move forward: (1) `angels when they sinned` and (2) `chains...until judgment`. We have angels that sinned and are currently being bound by chains in Hell (Tartarus). Jude describes it almost the exact same way in Jude 1:6, but he notes an interesting distinction:

> <u>Jude 1:6</u>: And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day

The crucial distinction I want to draw your attention to in that passage in Jude is the angels `left their proper dwelling`, so let's also keep that in mind as we continue. 

Before we do continue, however, let's do a quick recap. First, we have angels that sinned. Second, these angels left their proper dwelling, i.e., Heaven. Third, we know these angels that sinned are currently bound by chains in Hell until the final judgement. But the two things we still need to know are:

1. *What* was the angels' sin?
2. *When* was the angels' sin?

Conveniently for us, we can know both answers in one passage in Genesis chapter 6. Since we already know *what* demons are, we need to know where they came from. 

## Where Demons Came From
### The Nephilim
> <u>Genesis 6:1-4:</u><br>
> **1** And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,<br>
> **2** That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.<br>
> **3** And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br>
> **4** There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

### The Angel's Sin
We have a sort of uncomfortable and slightly awkward story of "*sons of God*" (angels) procreating with the women of earth. This cohabitation between kinds produced the Nephilim, which were mentioned in that passage to be that of giants. We have these angels that `left their proper dwelling` as Jude said in verse 6 to procreate with humankind. Now, remember when I mentioned "unclean spirits" a little earlier? Something being deemed "unclean" could have many meanings. One of which being a "forbidden mixture." Angels mixing with humankind would certainly be understood as being a "forbidden mixture." Therefore, to bring this full circle with our previous recap, and to answer our two questions from above, we need to do a little unpacking.

### Unpacking It All
First, we have "*what was the angels' sin?*" The sin being the angels leaving their dwelling of Heaven to procreate with humankind. Second, we have "*when was the angels' sin?*" Genesis 6 was after the fall of man (Genesis 3) and before the 1st coming of the Messiah. The angels sinned just after the fall of man. This is important because no other place in the Bible mentions a time when angels sinned, so we can assume this is the **only** passage that 2nd Peter and Jude were referring to. Third, these angels are currently bound by chains in Hell. So, we can't have these angels be demons if they are currently bound, right?
 
### Early Beliefs
If you had the ability to ask 1st Century Jews or [2nd temple Judaism](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780195393361/obo-9780195393361-0087.xml#:~:text=obo%2F9780195393361%2D0087-,Introduction,Roman%20forces%20in%2070%20CE) practitioners what demons are, they taught much more immediate answers to this question. These two groups believed demons were disembodied sprits of dead descendants of the Nephilim, often called the Rephaim. And we can draw a lot of comparisons to this teaching with what we went through in this post. Remember we had the angels descend from Heaven, procreate with mankind, then they were bound after that very sin? Well, demons clearly couldn't be Nephilim since they are bound by chains. However, the *departed* spirits of the Nephilim, those dead spirits, i.e., the Rephaim, are never said to be bound. If these disembodied spirits are free to roam, therefore they seek to become re-embodied and possess the physical such as people, animals, or objects like how the Bible teaches. Jesus hints at this in the book of Matthew:

> <u>Matthew 12:43</u>: When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.   

These unclean spirits (demons) are the products of angels, but not necessarily angels themselves. They are not bound like the Nephilim, so they can roam to and fro. Since they are disembodied spirit beings, they seek to be re-embodied through means of possession.   

## Conclusion
Demons are often taught to be fallen angels. This is somewhat close to the truth as fallen angels created the Nephilim by procreating with the women of earth. The dead descendants of the Nephilim, the Rephaim, are those very disembodied spirits that we come to know as demons. This is what early 1st century Jews and other ancient teachings taught. By using the Bible, we can all but prove this theory because of several key points. One, the most taught verses in Revelation 12 were never referring to angels defecting with Satan Pre-Fall of Man (Genesis 3), but rather, this was in correlation to the 1st coming of the Messiah. Therefore, if these same fallen angels were demons, how do we describe demons being mentioned in the Old Testament *much* before the coming of Christ? Second, we know that demons are not physical beings and cannot be bound by chains, much unlike the Nephilim. The Rephaim, however, were never mentioned to have been bound, meaning they can roam to and fro. The Bible mentions demons as roaming around seeking inhabitants to embody. With all these points mentioned in this post, I hope that I was able to shed some light in helping you better understand what demons are and where they came from. If you would like a deeper study, I linked the videos that inspired this post by Dr. Michael Heiser, as 90% of the points mentioned here were from his videos below.

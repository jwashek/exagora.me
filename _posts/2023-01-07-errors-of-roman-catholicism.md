## Intro
Have you ever seen those math riddles where it shows a picture of several random objects and then the sum of those objects? Your job is to figure out the amount of each of those objects, say a car, a battery, and a person. If there are three sets of batteries that equal 30, you know that each set of batteries must be equal to 10. What if the final equation is parts of what you already know but you need to ensure the sum adds up correctly? Instead of a set of batteries, maybe it's just one. Instead of a car, maybe there are two people inside the car? Now you have to calculate for 2 people, a car, and a single battery. I did one of those riddles recently and I thought for sure I had the answer. Since I missed just *one* tiny detail that I overlooked--two people in the car--my entire sum was off to the point where I wasn't even close to the true answer.

I couldn't help but think of how true this scenario applies to false doctrine within the Church these days. We may have good intentions in thinking we calculated our "objects" (or doctrine) properly, but if we're adding or subtracting those objects improperly even slightly, we're always going to come up short in our equation and we won't reach the intended sum. Directing our attention too closely to the objects without considering the sum (or Christ) is a sure recipe for disaster. And this is exactly what the Catholic Church does today. They add objects and equations that draw the attention away from the Sum--the true focus we should be attentive of. 

### The Objects 
#### Mary
![image-left]({{ '/images/catholic_idolaters.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} Catholics always seem to be defending their position the most when questioned about Mary. Some of these questions made from other faiths or even atheists/agnostics are very valid and hard to be ignored. Some of these might range from "*Why do you worship Mary?*" to "*Was Mary a co-mediator/co-redeemer with Christ?*" Regardless of their defenses to these particular questions, this does not deny the fact that there are countless pictures and other examples where Catholics do bow down to statues of Mary (such as is seen in the picture linked in this paragraph), place idols around their house or church of Mary, etc. To bow down to a statue, kiss its feet, or even pray to it is a bizarre type of reverence that takes the focus from Jesus and places it to a false idol; regardless of the fact this was the mother who bore the Savior, the mother was **not** the Savior herself and needed Jesus just like everyone else did. But no matter that, [Exodus 20:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20%3A4-5&version=ESV) plainly tells us not to make any images of anything in heaven and not to **bow down to it**. The amount of mental gymnastics the common Catholic needs to exert themselves to just to defend their position and twist scriptures to fit their narrative is astounding, as we'll soon see.  

| Question  | Defense  |
|---|---|
| How can Mary be a Co-Redeemer with Christ?  | She gave free consent to give life to the Redeemer, which meant sharing his life, suffering, and death, which were redemptive for the world.  |

### The Equation
Just like an equation in mathematics being, `a statement that the values of two mathematical expressions are equal`, Catholicism's equation is: xyz.

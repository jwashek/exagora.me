## Intro
Have you ever seen those math riddles where it shows a picture of several random objects and then the sum of those objects? Your job is to figure out the amount of each of those objects, say a car, a battery, and a person by knowing the sum. If there are three sets of batteries that equal 30, you know that each set of batteries must be equal to 10. What if the final equation is parts of what you already know but you need to ensure the sum adds up correctly? Instead of a set of batteries, maybe it's just one. Instead of a car, maybe there are two people inside the car? Now you must calculate for 2 people, a car, and a single battery. I did one of those riddles recently and I thought for sure I had the answer. Since I missed just *one* tiny detail that I overlooked--two people in the car--my entire sum was off to the point where I wasn't even close to the true answer.

I couldn't help but think of how true this scenario applies to false doctrine within the Church these days. We may have good intentions in thinking we calculated our "objects" (or doctrine) properly, but if we're adding or subtracting those objects improperly or even slightly, we're always going to come up short in our equation and we won't reach the intended sum. Directing our attention too closely to the objects without considering the sum (or Christ) is a sure recipe for disaster. And this is exactly what the Catholic Church does today. They add objects and equations that draw the attention away from the Sum--the true focus we should be attentive of. 

### The Objects 
#### Mary
Catholics always seem to be defending their position the most when questioned about Mary. Some of these questions made from other faiths or even atheists/agnostics are very valid and hard to be ignored. Some of these might range from "*Why do you worship Mary?*" to "*Was Mary a co-redeemer with Christ?*" Regardless of their defenses to these questions, this does not deny the fact that there are [countless examples](https://www.nairaland.com/2181775/11-photos-praying-bowing-down#31358532) where Catholics do bow down to statues of Mary, place idols around their house or church of Mary, pray to these very idols, etc. To bow down to a statue, kiss its feet, or even pray to it is a bizarre type of reverence that takes the focus from worshipping Jesus and places it to a false idol; regardless of the fact this was the mother who bore the Savior, the mother was **not** the Savior herself and needed Jesus just like everyone else did/does. But no matter that, [Exodus 20:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20%3A4-5&version=ESV) plainly tells us not to make any images of anything in heaven and not to **bow down to it**. The amount of mental gymnastics the common Catholic needs to exert themselves to in order to defend their position is astounding, as we'll soon see.  

| Question  | Defense  |
|---|---|
| How can Mary be a Co-Redeemer with Christ?  | "She gave free consent to give life to the Redeemer, which meant sharing his life, suffering, and death, which were redemptive for the world."  |
| Why do you pray to Mary?   | "Intercessory prayer through Mary (as well as other saints) still makes sense as in the same way that we ask Christian friends and family on earth to pray for us."  |
| Why do you worship Mary instead of Jesus?  | "First of all, Catholics do not worship Mary. We honor her because she is the mother of Jesus."  |

There are obviously many more questions surrounding Mary alone, but these are just to name a few for the sake of time. 

**Answering the Defenses**<br>
If you pay close attention to the first defense where it's mentioned `...which meant sharing in his life, suffering, and death...`, Paul addresses this in [Galatians 2:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A20&version=KJV) by saying he was `...crucified with Christ...` In a sense, Paul is saying we **all** share this with Christ, not just Mary. Furthermore, Paul says that we were "*baptized into His death*" in [Romans 6:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A3&version=ESV). And if we are baptized into His death through our faith in Jesus, we are "*one body*" as [1st Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012%3A13&version=ESV) says. Why don't Catholics worship each other or *every* believer if we all share in the death of Christ like they seem to claim only Mary does? Their defense of this is a weak attempt at explaining away their blasphemous position that Mary is a Co-Reedemer with Christ.

Let me pose a question to answer the next two defenses. Consider the following ["Three Hail Mary's"](https://visitationproject.org/pages/the-three-hail-marys):

> *1<sup>st</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, Daughter of the Eternal Father, and I consecrate to Thee my soul with all its faculties.<br>
> *2<sup>nd</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, beloved Mother of the Son of God. I consecrate to Thee my body with all its senses.<br>
> *3<sup>rd</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, beloved Spouse of the Holy Ghost, I consecrate to Thee my heart, with all its affections and beseech Thee to obtain for me from the Most Holy Trinity all the graces necessary for salvation.

My question is this: does this seem like an `intercessory prayer...to pray for us`; or does this seem like `honor...because she is the mother of Jesus`? That is absolutely abhorrent for Catholics to claim this type of prayer is intercessory, i.e., on our behalf, or just honoring Mary. This is worship, plain and simple. Reading the "Three Hail Mary's" above should make that abundantly clear. Consider [Deuteronomy 6:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206%3A5&version=KJV) which says for us to love the LORD with our whole heart, but Catholics are praising Mary with their whole heart and claiming it's just intercessory or honor? This type of delusional thinking can only be found in those who've been "*blinded by the god of this world*." [(2nd Corinthians 4:4)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+4%3A4&version=ESV) Even more disgusting is the last part of the "Three Hail Mary's" where it mentions that Mary obtains for us `graces necessary for salvation`. Do you not see how this is placing more faith/trust/belief in Mary than in Jesus Christ? Catholics are praying to Mary and asking that she bestow upon them grace in order to obtain salvation. If you do not see the above as idolatry, I would ask that you carefully "*examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith*" [(2nd Corinthians 13:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=KJV), because this should be repugnant to any believer to feel okay in praying with this type of adoration, reverence, and worship to **anyone** other than Jesus Christ.

**What Did Jesus Say of Mary?**<br>
> <u>Luke 11:27-28</u>:<br>
> **27** And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.<br>
> **28** But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

Jesus shut the woman down by not agreeing with her above statement in Scriptures. Rather He mentions to this woman that anyone who hears the word of God and keeps it is blessed; Jesus didn't put Mary on a pedestal like the Catholics do.

Secondly, we have a story where Jesus is teaching and is interrupted by someone in the crowd. How He answers this person is very telling.

> <u>Matthew 12:47-50</u>:<br>
> **47** Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.<br>
> **48** But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?<br>
> **49** And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
> **50** For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

Now, the point here is that Jesus was preaching and teaching and one in the crowd said to Him, "Hey, your mother and brothers are out here and want to talk to you." Jesus answers this by asking them a question, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?" I want you to notice two things here. First, Jesus mentions that anyone that does the will of the Father *is* His brother, sister, and mother. Secondly, notice how Jesus says brother, sister, and mother, but He did not say Father. Why? [Matthew 23:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023%3A9&version=KJV) explains this because there's only One that deserves to be called Father and that is Almighty God. In other words, Jesus does not venerate Mary in the sense that Catholics do; He regarded her as His earthly mother, but not above anyone that `hears the word of God and keeps it` or `does the will of the Father`.

#### Catechisms and Church Tradition
**Sola Scriptura**<br>
Catholics do not believe in [*Sola Scriptura*](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-terms/what-is-sola-scriptura.html), or the idea of "scripture alone" being the sole authority of faith and practice for believers. Now, Catholics are correct in saying that the term or phrase "scripture alone" is not found in the Bible; technically this is true, albeit this is an ineffective attempt at defending their position. We see several examples where Scripture is held to the utmost standard and authority such as [Acts 17:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+17%3A11&version=KJV) when the Bereans are commended for "*searching the scriptures*." Otherwise, traditions of men--such as the Catechisms and other church traditions that Catholics ascribe equal importance to the Bible for--is flat-out rejected (as we'll soon see). But first, let's go back to the Bereans.

> <u>Acts 17:11</u>: These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

The Bereans were presented information and searched the scriptures to verify the claims and its truthfulness. Why would the Bereans be commended for searching the Scriptures--and only the Scriptures--to verify information they received if this wasn't supposed to be used as a supreme authority for believers? Paul goes a step further in instructing the Church at Corinth to "*not go beyond what is written*" in [1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+4%3A6&version=ESV). Wouldn't it be safe to assume that going beyond what is written would be holding to tradition or other teachings other than the Scripture? Alternatively, Paul instructed the believers at the Church in Colossae to be vigilant so that they're not "*taken captive by vain deceit, after the traditions of men*" in [Colossians 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A8&version=KJV). Scripture points this out in several places, but Catholics attempt to explain it away to keep their traditions taught through Catechisms or previous popes, which is strangely ironic since Jesus addressed this very thing in the book of Mark. Jesus mentioned 2 times in back-to-back verses that certain hypocrites were "*laying aside the commandments of God to hold to the traditions of men*." 

> <u>Mark 7:6-9</u>:<br>
> **6** He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.<br>
> **7** Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br>
> **8** For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.<br>
> **9** And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

**Catechisms**<br>
Catholics hold the Catechisms and other church traditions on equal value with Scripture since they do not believe Scripture has the ultimate authority and subsequently, they don't believe that it's the only rule of faith and practice for believers. In short, a ["catechism"](https://uscatholic.org/articles/201106/what-is-the-catechism-of-the-catholic-church/) is defined as "*an organized presentation of the essential teachings of the Catholic Church in regard to both faith and morals*." Catechisms are typically in the format of creeds or beliefs which are later expounded upon, such as in [Chapter Two](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1D.HTM) which states: "*I believe in Jesus Christ, the only son of God*." This is further broken down into several sub-points which describe this belief even further. Now, I'm not here to disagree or nitpick at every Catechism, because there are certainly some that we as born-again believers would agree with. But, if you could have guessed, there are *many* that are wildly unbiblical such as in Section Two which define the [Seven Sacraments](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM). False doctrine is very, very subtle and often sandwiched between truth to hide its true intent. 

A lot of the Catechisms were not Scripture-derived, but rather presented by Cardinals, Bishops, or even Popes themselves. Do you see now why Catholics don't believe in *Sola Scriptura*? It's because they trust mere men and their interpretation of Scripture (not in all cases as many Catechisms are found nowhere in Scripture) and follow their teachings as much as they claim they do with the Bible. I can't help but be reminded of [Acts chapter 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15%3A1-30&version=KJV) of the Jerusalem Council where "certain men" taught that you could not be saved unless you were circumcised. Interestingly enough, in verse 5 of Acts chapter 15 it is mentioned that the Pharisees added "keeping the Law of Moses" to the already added requirement of "circumcision" to be saved. These *minor* additions are precisely what the Catholics do with their Catechisms and is equally dangerous to believers that are unfortunate enough to be ensnared by their false doctrine. If we compare Scripture with Scripture and "*search the scriptures*" as [John 5:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205%3A39&version=KJV) mentions, then we as believers will be able to spot inaccuracies and false doctrine. Remember above in Acts 17 with the Bereans? These were considered noble people because they searched the scriptures to compare if what they were being taught was truth. Is the Seven Sacraments and other Catholic church traditions truth? For Catholics, they would never be able to answer that because they cannot use only their Bible. Possibly they need to have John 5:39 rewritten to read: "*search the scriptures **and the Catechisms and other Church Traditions**...*"

**Church Traditions**<br>
Much like the Catechisms, Catholics hold church traditions on the same playing field as the Scriptures. Some of these traditions include:
  * Observing the [sacraments](https://www.britannica.com/list/the-seven-sacraments-of-the-roman-catholic-church)
  * Praying the [rosary](https://www.usccb.org/how-to-pray-the-rosary)
  * [Lighting candles](https://www.mercyhome.org/blog/sunday-mass/why-are-prayer-candles-used-in-the-catholic-church/#:~:text=In%20our%20churches%20today%2C%20we,we%20continue%20on%20our%20day)
  * Baptism of infants
  * Confession of sins to a priest, then, in turn, performing ["penance"](https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/penance) for those sins

The problem with holding to these traditions is that most of them are not even based off Scripture, or for the ones that are, they are being heavily twisted to fit the Catholics' doctrine. For example, the sacraments (i.e., Baptism, Holy Communion, Confirmation, Reconciliation, Anointing the Sick, Marriage, and Ordination) include some truth found in Scripture. Take `baptism` for example. The issue here is that baptism is not required for salvation and nowhere in the Bible does it mention that infants were baptized. 

Another example can be seen through `confirmation`. It is biblical to anoint with oil and the laying on of hands through prayer is mentioned through the New Testament; however, this is twisted by Catholics by them typically taking the name of a saint symbolically to be their patron saint after confirmation. Paul condemned this thinking in [1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 3:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A4-5&version=KJV) where the Corinthian church were claiming apostles that they followed. Paul says, "*why do you say you are of Paul or Apollos; we're just ministers by Who you believed*."

### The Equation
Tying this all back to the original theme and inspiration of this post through the math riddle, we looked at the objects (i.e., Mary, The Catechisms, and Church Tradition), and now it's time to put it all together and figure out the Catholics' equation--here being symbolic to their method of salvation. Just like an equation in mathematics being, `a statement that the values of two mathematical expressions are equal`, Catholicism's equation for salvation includes: baptism, good works, faith, keeping the sacraments, keeping the Ten Commandments, and penance.

This equation obviously doesn't consider verses such as [John 3:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A14-16&version=KJV), [Acts 16:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+16%3A31&version=KJV), [Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=KJV), [Acts 10:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+10%3A43&version=KJV) or [Ephesians 1:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+1%3A13-14&version=KJV). An even better example would be the thief on the cross. How would the thief on the cross have been saved, by [Jesus' own words](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023%3A43&version=KJV), if he followed a false plan of salvation like the Catholics teach? 

Let's see just how Catholics hold the sacraments. Here are some quotes regarding the importance of the sacraments in salvation:

> "*[Are the sacraments necessary for salvation?] According to the way God has willed that we be saved, the sacraments are necessary for salvation*." -- John Hardon, *The Question and Answer Catholic Catechism* Question # 1119

> "*If any one saith that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation...and that without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain from God, through faith alone, the grace of justification...let him be anathema*." -- Philip Schaff, *The Creeds of Christendom* Canon IV, p. 119

This is very dangerous doctrine and is clearly [another gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+1%3A8-9&version=KJV). If we are to be noble like the Bereans, we would search the Scriptures to see if *these things were so*. In so doing, you will find nothing where it teaches you must keep the Law, perform sacraments, or perform any other effort on our part to obtain salvation.

## Conclusion
Catholicism adds heretical teachings (objects) to their plan of salvation (equation) which throws off the entirety of the true sum (Christ) they claim their equation points to. However, these objects such as Mary, the Catechisms, and church tradition hold little to no Biblical truth. For example, Catholics claim they do not worship Mary, yet they recite "Hail Mary's" and even a more blasphemous version called the "Three Hail Mary's" where they state, "With my whole heart, I praise thee." Additionally, you do not need to search very far before you see pictures of Catholics bowing down to and praying to statues of Mary. A second object Catholics add to their equation is that of the Catechisms. These are essential teachings of the Catholic church that sandwich Biblical truth with traditions or teachings of men, such as that of the sacraments. The sacraments are, according to Catholics themselves, essential for salvation. So much so that they claim anathema (or a curse) upon those that do not believe the sacraments are necessary for salvation. These heretical teachings are "another Gospel" as Galatians 1:8-9 state and point to another Jesus. Since their equation adds their own heresies such as infant baptism, keeping the Ten Commandments, performing good works, confession, confirmation, penance, and a slew of other additions, their sum will never align with the true Sum.

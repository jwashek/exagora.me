## TL;DR
In my personal journey of getting back to a more ancient view of the Christian faith--a more apostolic understanding of Christian beliefs--no doubt Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy presented themselves as potential, viable options for me to further explore. However, in listening to hours of Catholic and Orthodox apologists, watching dozens *more* hours of debates, and especially through reading the Ante-Nicene fathers, my conscience prevents me from a full conversion to Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy. My three main reasons include: their view on Mary (or "[Theotokos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theotokos)" as espoused in Eastern Orthodoxy), their stance on images and icons, and their sectarian view of salvation.

## My Main Issues
### Mary
**Catholic's View**<br>
Catholic and Orthodox Christians have a very similar view on the Virgin Mary. However, Protestants almost cringe when hearing the name "Mary" because they put little to no emphasis on her role, when in fact, she played a *huge* role in bearing our Lord Jesus--God in the flesh. We should respect the Virgin Mary for her obedient and willing role to bear our Savior--and for that, all generations should call her blessed (Luke 1:48)--and rightfully so. This is not a problem and should never be a problem to a Protestant, but they tend to make it one.

But what should hold a problem for *any* Christian is blatant blasphemous idolatry such as Pope John Paul II's famous *Totus Tuus* expression. This, in Latin, means "Totally Yours." Now, this expression is all well and good if it's in reference to the right person... but, sadly, it was not. This was in reference to Mary. 

> "*Here is the explanation of the origin of the Totus Tuus. The expression comes from St. Louis Maria Grignion of Montfort. It is the abbreviation of the more complete form of entrusting oneself to the Mother of God*." -- quote from [Queen of All Hearts](https://queenofallhearts.com/2021/06/25/st-pope-john-paul-ii-explains-his-motto-totus-tuus/)

Totus Tuus even sparked many churches and Catholic programs teaching devotion to Mary. A devotion so well understood that even the term "Marian devotion" was coined. Here's one such program: [Totus Tuus](https://totustuus.church/sites/totustuus/files/overview_of_totus_tuus.pdf). Please note under "*The Five Pillars of Totus Tuus*" on page 3 that "Marian Devotion" is listed as the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar. 

Marian devotion is quite simple. It's essentially just various devotions or other practices directed towards Mary--one of which states `Praying with
her and to her`. Even the staunchest of Catholics vehemently deny praying to Mary, so how come they teach children it's okay to? In any case, "devotion" in and of itself is a problem that is seemingly neglected by the Catholic Church. Need I define [devotion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devotion)? 

```
1 a: religious fervor : PIETY 
  b: an act of prayer or private worship —> usually used in plural  
  > during his morning devotions
  c: a religious exercise or practice other than the regular corporate worship of a congregation
2 a: the act of dedicating something to a cause, enterprise, or activity : the act of devoting
  > the devotion of a great deal of time and energy
  b: the fact or state of being ardently dedicated and loyal
  > her devotion to the cause
  > filial devotion
```

Let's reason with each other for just a moment. Catholics claim they do not commit idolatry or worship Mary, yet the definition above certainly suggests otherwise. Putting that aside, prayer, which was already proven to be found within the Totus Tuus program, is something that should only *ever* be given to the Creator, not a creature--*that* is undeniably idolatry. But, if that doesn't prove problematic, please consider the following ["Three Hail Mary's"](https://visitationproject.org/pages/the-three-hail-marys):

> *1<sup>st</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, Daughter of the Eternal Father, and I consecrate to Thee my soul with all its faculties.<br>
> *2<sup>nd</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, beloved Mother of the Son of God. I consecrate to Thee my body with all its senses.<br>
> *3<sup>rd</sup>*: With all my heart I praise Thee, Most Holy Virgin above all angels and saints in Paradise, beloved Spouse of the Holy Ghost, I consecrate to Thee my heart, with all its affections and beseech Thee to obtain for me from the Most Holy Trinity all the graces necessary for salvation.

Deuteronomy 6:5 commands us to love the LORD with our whole heart, but Catholics are praising Mary with their whole heart? 

But maybe the nail in the coffin is that of Alphonsus de Liguori and his book titled, "*[The Glories of Mary](https://www.amazon.com/Glories-Mary-Liguori-Classic/dp/0764806645)*." A book that has been through 800+ revisions since its writing. Alphonsus was a Cardinal who lived during the 17th century and was a devout Catholic. Let's examine what he says about Mary in his book:

> "It is impossible for a client of Mary, who is faithful in honoring and recommending himself to her, to be lost."

> "The salvation of those who are not protected by Mary is impossible."

> "All those who are not thy servants, O Mary, will perish."

> "O mother of God, if I place my confidence in thee, I shall be saved. If I am under thy protection, I have nothing to fear, for the fact of being thy client is the possession of a certainty of salvation, and which God only grants to those whom He intends to save."

This is disgusting blasphemy at nearly the highest level.

**Eastern Orthodoxy’s View**<br>
The Eastern Orthodox have similar expressions to the Virgin Mary, or Theotokos, as they call her. Now, to start, I have absolutely *no* problem calling the Blessed Virgin Mary "Theotokos" (literally meaning "God-bearer"). I believe the Lord Jesus was God incarnate, and if I hold to that view, then I believe she was the God-bearer. Though not a problem for me, what does hold a problem for me is the following:

> "O Virgin, spotless, undefiled, unstained, all-chaste and Pure Lady, Bride of God...who art the hope of the hopeless, the helper of the oppressed, the ready protection of those who hasten unto thee, and the refuge of Christians; despise me not, who am defiled and sinful, who by my wicked thoughts, words and deeds, have become an unworthy servant, and by my slothfulness have turned into a slave to evil affections. O Mother of the God of Love, have mercy and compassion upon me, a sinner and a prodigal." -- [The Saint Gregory Palamas Outreach](http://www.saintgregoryoutreach.org/2010/01/prayers-to-mother-of-god.html)

Mary is the hope of the hopeless? She's the refuge of Christians? I thought God was our hope (Romans 15:13) and our refuge (Psalm 62:8 and Deuteronomy 33:27)?

> "Most Holy Theotokos save us. I have you as the shelter and the defence of my life, you, the Theotokos and Virgin; pilot and govern me into your sheltered port, for you are author of good things and support of the faithful, O you the only allpraised one." -- [The Service of the Small Paraklisis to the Most Holy and Ever-Virgin Theotokos](https://www.greekorthodoxmonastery.org/small-paraklisis-to-theotokos#:~:text=you%20the%20only%20allpraised%20one)

Calling out to Mary to save us... telling Mary she is our shelter and the defence of our life... and, worst of all, telling Mary she is the "author of good things" and that she's the "*only* allpraised one." If this is hyperbolic language, it's a poor choice of words at best, and utter blasphemy at worst.

### Icons and Images
If that wasn't bad enough, we've reached my second issue: icons and images. The Second Council of Nicaea (787 AD) declared a harrowing [decree](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3819.htm) against anyone who does not venerate icons used within the Church:

> "The things which we have decreed...that the images of our Lord Jesus Christ as man, and those of the undefiled Mother of God, the ever-virgin Mary, and of the honourable Angels and of all Saints, should be venerated and saluted. **And if anyone does not so believe, but undertakes to debate the matter further and is evil affected with regard to the veneration due the sacred images**, such an one **our holy ecumenical council...anathematises**. Now anathema is **nothing less than complete separation from God** (emphasis added)."

Let's recap: if we don't venerate icons, but even if we simply *debate* it, we are anathematized. And, if we had any question as to what that meant, they define it as nothing less than a complete separation from God. This should spark terror into the hearts of anyone inquiring Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy.

Both Catholic and Orthodox Christians hold to this council, which is why they still have icons, images, and statues used in their worship today. But, what turned me away from icons--apart from the dreadful decree issued above--was that of reading the early church fathers and their stance on icons and images. For example:

> "For God is not seen, He should be worshipped with things that are not seen." -- Lactantius, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume VII p. 193

> "It is asserted by some pagans that, although these are only images, yet there exist gods in honor of whom they are made. They say that the prayers and sacrifices presented to the images are to be referred to the gods, and are in fact made to the gods." -- Athenagoras, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume II p. 137

I found this quote particularly interesting since, in my many hours of listening to Orthodox apologists and even attending a few Orthodox liturgies, I heard this exact defense made many, *many* times. They claimed that the images are not receiving the veneration, but the person behind it.

> "They call themselves Gnostics. They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material. They maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them...They have also other modes of honoring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles." -- Irenaeus, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I p. 351

This was another interesting quote to me since many Orthodox priests and apologists use a strikingly similar argument: "*Luke was the first iconographer*," and they use that claim to justify their icon usage, much like the Gnostics did with saying Pilate made an image of Christ. Though no real historical backing supports Luke being the first iconographer, and certainly nothing found within the Ante-Nicene fathers, the Catholic and Orthodox Christians still defend icons and images by appealing to Luke.

> "It is with a different kind of spell that art deludes you...it leads you to pay religious honor and worship to images and pictures." -- Clement of Alexandria, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume II p. 188

> "Works of art cannot be sacred and divine." -- Clement of Alexandria, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume II p. 530

> "How could [Peter] have known Moses and Elijah except in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, statues, or likeness. For the Law forbade that." -- Tertullian, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume III p. 383

> "Neither painter or image-maker existed in the nation of Israel, for the Law expelled all such persons from it. In that way, there was no pretext for the construction of images. For image-making is an art that attracts the attention of foolish men. It drags the eyes of the soul down from God to earth." -- Origen, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume IV p. 510

> "For none of these other groups abhor altars and images on the ground that they are afraid of degrading the worship of God and reducing it to the worship of material things...it is not possible at the same time to know God and address prayers to images." -- Origen, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume IV pp. 635-637

> "The sacred images themselves, to which most senseless men render service, are destitute of all perception. For they are earth." -- Lactantius, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume VII p. 67 

> "Without a doubt, there is no religion wherever there is an image. For religion consists of divine things, and there is nothing divine except in Heavenly things. So, it follows that images are without religion. For there can be nothing Heavenly in something that is made from the earth." -- Lactantius, Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume VII p. 68


### Sectarianism
The Orthodox Church is the true church... no, wait, the Catholic Church is the true church...

Both Catholics and Orthodox claim they are the "true church" and damn all others that are not within the bounds of their church. So, which is true? Because both can't be. And, when you have a quote from the Council of Florence to follow, it makes this a surreal, yet horrifying reality for any truth-seeker honestly trying to find where best to serve God.

**Council of Florence**<br>
In [Session 11](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/ecumenical-council-of-florence-1438-1445-1461#:~:text=outside%20the%20catholic%20church) of the Council of Florence (1438-1445 AD), a decree was issued which stated: 

> "It firmly believes, professes, and proclaims that **those not living within the Catholic Church**, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics, **cannot become participants in eternal life**, but will depart 'into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matthew 25:41), unless before the end of life they are joined to her; and that the unity of this ecclesiastical body is so strong that only for those remaining in it are the sacraments of the Church of benefit for salvation, and do fasts, almsgivings, and other works of piety and practices of the Christian militia productive of eternal rewards. **And that no one, whatever almsgiving he has practiced, even if he has shed blood for the name of Christ, can be saved, unless he has remained in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church**. (emphasis added)"

I believe this is where Mark 9:38-41 shines with the brightness of the sun. The apostle John asked the Lord Jesus if they should forbid those who were casting out demons in His name since they were not "with them." What was our Lord's response? He told John that, "*whoever is not against us is for us*." He also said those who show compassion to the apostles (inferring this same group that was not physically with the disciples) will "*certainly not lose their reward.*" This flies in the face of the Council of Florence which says that, even if someone sheds blood for Christ, they cannot be saved if they're not part of the Catholic Church.

I'll believe the Lord Jesus and His own words over a council 1,400+ years after His resurrection and ascension.

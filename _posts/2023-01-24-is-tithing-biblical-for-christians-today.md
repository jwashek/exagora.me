## Intro
Turn on the TV today and you'll undoubtedly see mega-church pastors and ["Prosperity Gospel"](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/what-you-should-know-about-the-prosperity-gospel/) teachers preach on one thing: tithing. Citing several verses such as Malachi 3:8, 1st Corinthians 16:1, or 2nd Corinthians 9:7, these teachers claim that we are commanded to tithe as believers today. However, it's not just these Prosperity Gospel teachers that preach on tithing; if you grew up in just about any church denomination, tithing is something that you likely have given very little thought in doing--you just did it because the pastor said we are commanded to. The problem with these teachers is they provide little context or give way to the true intent of tithing. So, what is the context and what is tithing's true intent? And is tithing *really* a New Testament command? 

## The First Mention
The first mention of tithing is found all the way back in Genesis 14. Abram (later Abraham) just went to war with various tribes including the Amalekites and those in Sodom and Gomorrah. In verse 11 it mentions, "*And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way*." This is important because in verse 20, Abraham is seen to give Melchizedek a tithe of all those spoils from war.

> <u>Genesis 14:20</u>: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

We see the very first mention of a tithe to be that of spoils of war and not finances such as money, gold, or silver. More on this later.

## Who Was Tithing Meant For?
### Sons of Levi
Hebrews chapter 7 recounts this war from Genesis 14 in the beginning verses. However, there are two key verses found in Hebrews to pay close attention to--verses 4 and 5 of Hebrews chapter 7, which state:

> <u>Hebrews 7:4-5</u>:<br>
> **4** Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.<br>
> **5** And verily **they that are of the sons of Levi**, who receive the office of the priesthood, **have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law**, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: (emphasis added)

Again, we see that Abraham gave 1/10<sup>th</sup> part of the *spoils* of war. But verse 5 shows something a little more noteworthy. I highlighted it above but note that the tithes are meant for the sons of Levi. They (sons of Levi) had a commandment to take tithes of the people. This was according to the Law. As for the reason for this commandment, we'll get into that in just a moment. First, let's understand something crucial before we go any further. 

### Context, Context, Context
The sons of Levi were Jews. This is probably obvious to most, but it has to be brought up because if we are to rightly divide the Word (2nd Timothy 2:15), then we first must understand who this applies to. Context is key. And context tells us--at least so far--that tithing is meant for a certain people (sons of Levi) at a certain time (under the Old Covenant Law). I hope to provide more context as we go through this information together, so it becomes even more clear, but knowing what we do now, tithing does not seem to be applicable to believers today under the New Covenant.

## What Was the Tithe?
### The Initial Tithe
As already mentioned, the tithe was everything gained from the spoils of war--at least the initial tithe. This was not Abraham's income, this was the spoils of war. But notice something else. The Bible never says Abraham was commanded to do this. Abraham gave the tithe out of his own heart. Another very interesting thing to note is that for the rest of Abraham's life, he is *never* mentioned of giving another tithe. Ever. 

### Other Tithes
> <u>Leviticus 27:30,32</u>:<br>
> **30** And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.<br>
> **32** And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.

In Leviticus chapter 27, we see more on tithing, but as it relates to *what* is tithed: seed, fruit, and animals. These are all things that could be eaten, and no mention of money or finances was provided here. Numbers chapter 18 clarifies Leviticus 27 further and even details back to why the commandment was given to the sons of Levi.

> <u>Numbers 18:11,12,21,24,26</u>:<br>
> **11** And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.<br>
> **12** All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord, them have I given thee.<br>
> **21** And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation<br>
> **24** But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.<br>
> **26** Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe

There are two main things I want to direct your attention to. The first is that of *what* is mentioned as a tithe. Oil, wine, grain--tithes here are mentioned as produce from the land, much like what was mentioned in Leviticus chapter 27. In addition to this, verse 11 of the book of Numbers chapter 18 mentions that **they shall eat of it**. If tithing was meant to be finances, how were the sons of Levi expected to eat money? The second thing I want to mention is found in verse 21 which states, "*I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve...*." The command to tithe is a direct benefit to the children of Levi as an inheritance for their service or sacrificial work as priests at the tabernacle.

> <u>Exodus 29:44</u> I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. Aaron also and his sons I will consecrate to serve me as priests.

As you can see in the above passage in Exodus, this directive was given by the LORD where He stated that **Aaron also and his sons** will serve as priests. Aaron was a direct descendent of Levi since he was his grandson. Aaron and his remaining generations were all considered to be of the "sons of Levi." And since there is no more Levitical priesthood--since it was done away with with Christ--it is safe to say that tithing does not apply anymore and was directly linked to the priesthood of the sons of Levi.

### Tithing Was Never Money
Now, most proponents of tithing, namely those that receive direct benefit such as the "Prosperity Gospel" teachers, will say things like, "*Well, tithes were fruit, oil, wine, and animals because that **was** their currency back in those days!*" This seems like a valid argument on the surface. But this can be dismantled using Deuteronomy 14:22-25. This passage speaks of carrying tithes to distant lands. If the travel was too difficult to carry all of the tithe (i.e., seed, grain, wine, oil, & animals), this passage mentions in verse 25 that, "...*then you shall turn it [the tithe] into money...*" and take it to the land where God chooses. If the tithe *was* currency as these teachers suggest, why are they trading it for an *actual* currency before they reached their land? 

## Tithing Proponent's Favorite Verses
### Malachi
Malachi 3:8 is often used as the de facto verse to teach tithing to New Testament believers. However, the context found in Malachi 1:1 states that it's written **to Israel**. Context is always important when reading a passage and attempting to determine the application to believers today. Not to mention, this is an Old Testament prophet in an Old Testament book. If we as New Testament believers under the New Covenant aren't observing other Old Covenant laws and ordinances that were done away with, then why are we still observing tithing which was meant for sons of Levi under the Old Covenant?  

### Did Jesus Command Tithing?
Some say, "*Well, didn't Jesus command tithing?*" The passage this is in reference to is found in Matthew 23:23. Jesus is pronouncing woes to Scribes and Pharisees. Jesus says that they paid tithes (mint, anise, cumin) and have neglected weightier matters of the Law. Firstly, tithing mentioned here was yet again food and not money. Secondly, Jesus was **always** admonishing the Scribes and Pharisees because their heart was far from God. Thirdly, who was Jesus talking to? Scribes and Pharisees... who were Jews. The Old Covenant was still in effect until Jesus died, but once He did, the New Covenant would be in effect (see Hebrews 9:16-17).

### "A Cheerful Giver"
> <u>1st Corinthians 16:1-2</u>:<br>
> **1** Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.<br>
> **2** Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.

The above passage is often quoted to prove a New Testament precedent for tithing. Those proponents of tithing use the above passage to mention that Paul is saying to tithe on a weekly basis. The interesting thing about this passage is that these same proponents never quote verse 3 which reads, "*And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.*." **Bring your liberality unto Jerusalem**. At this time of Paul's letter, there was still a lot of destitution with poor and starving saints that lived in Judaea and Jerusalem. The prophet Agabus prophesied an extreme famine (Acts 11:28-30) which was mentioned in Acts chapter 11 that came to pass during this time. Acts 11:30 mentions that men gave according to their ability and provided this to Barnabas and Saul (Paul's pre-conversion name). Sounds a lot like the passage in 1st Corinthians 16, we just read, right? 

Note here that this was **not at all** a collection for Paul's salary (which is what proponents teach that tithing is for Christians today), this was for those hurting brothers and sisters in Jerusalem and Judaea. This gift of giving to those affected believers was a gift on an as-needed basis which was collected and provided to them weekly. Another verse tithing proponents like to use is 2nd Corinthians 9:7. "God loves a cheerful giver." But this verse ties back to 1st Corinthians 16:1 and the context can be seen in 2nd Corinthians 9:1, which reads, "*Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints*." What was the ministry to the saints? It was none other than what was already mentioned: giving to the poor and starving believers in Jerusalem and Judaea. Paul was even said to be boasting to the Macedonians of the Corinthian believers' willingness to give. Paul goes on to say in 2nd Corinthians 9:4-5:

> <u>2nd Corinthians 9:4-5</u>:<br>
> **4** Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident.<br> 
> **5** So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.

Paul is essentially saying in his 2nd letter to the Corinthian church for them to prepare their generous gift beforehand as a matter of generosity and not of a grudging obligation to be expecting of anything in return. They were ready to help the saints who were in need. Context is rarely explained when it comes to tithing, especially by those who reap the most benefit from it. This was a one-time ordeal and not a strict command to be continued. Though these passages in 1st and 2nd Corinthians *were* referencing money, it was never (a) mentioned as a tithe or (b) used as a means to supply a salary for a pastor.

## The Heart of Tithing
### The Bad
Most wealthy pastors who use Malachi 3:8 to push their tithing narrative are ironically the ones "stealing from God in tithes and offerings," but in reverse. Instead of *not* giving to God by proper tithing, they are *taking* tithes from God's people and using it for their own selfish desires such as [private jets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/06/04/wealthy-televangelist-explains-his-fleet-private-jets-its-biblical-thing/), [exorbitant mansions](https://www.distractify.com/p/joel-osteen-houses), or [lavish sports cars](https://news.yahoo.com/celebrity-preacher-faces-backlash-photos-214655283.html). Imagine the backlash the apostle Paul would have received had he taken the money meant for the hurting believers in Jerusalem and Judaea and used it for his own benefit. This is *precisely* what pastors are doing today. Imagine being a pastor who has every ability to help believers in similar situations as those Jews faced back in 1st Corinthians, yet instead they buy private jets, mansions, and sports cars. Imagine being in the poor and starving believers' shoes and what they would think had they seen disgustingly rich "Christians" walk by with snubbed noses and fistfuls of cash without throwing even but a mere dime their way (Hebrews 13:16), (1st John 3:17). This is not the heart we should have as believers. And as such, we should **not** be willing to accept this behavior of any Bible teacher. This is reprehensible and can only be seen as unloving and selfish. They are selling Christ for a profit. Jesus said it right when He said:

> <u>Mark 7:6</u>: He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

### The Good
Before I wrap up this post, I think it's crucial to mention I am not at all saying that we shouldn't tithe. What I am saying is that, under the New Covenant, we are not commanded to tithe. In addition, tithing was never through monetary means. However, if your heart feels so convicted to provide finances to your local church, by all means, do it. We should do exactly what Paul was commending the Corinthian believers for in 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 9. They were giving from their hearts to provide for truly hurting believers. This is loving, selfless, and hospitable. These are all actions we should strive to do as believers (Romans 12:13, Hebrews 6:10, and Romans 12:10), but not as a weekly ordinance meant for the Church of believers today.

## Conclusion
As we've seen, tithing is not applicable to believers under the New Covenant today. The verses typically used by tithing proponents (i.e., usually those which benefit greatly from tithing) will never teach the context or perform deep expositions into those verses. With the very verses these teachers use, we examined in context their true intent and meaning. For example, the origin of tithing was provided to the sons of Levi as an inheritance to them. Malachi 1:1 states that it was written to Israel, and not the Church (this is rather obvious because the Church hadn't been formed yet since this is an Old Testament book written hundreds of years before Christ)--this means that you cannot use Malachi 3:8 to instruct the Church to tithe since the context of that book was written to Israel. Going to New Testament verses, the context of 2nd Corinthians 9:7 is in direct relation to 1st Corinthians 16 where Paul had instructed the church to give to those hurting believers in Jerusalem and Judaea which were starving, poor, and destitute. If you're going to use single verses to prove a dogmatic viewpoint, it is key to understanding its context, since *text without context is pretext*. Now, I'm not suggesting that you shouldn't be providing financially to those in need or even to a church through your personal finance; what I am saying is that, as a religious duty, giving 1/10<sup>th</sup> of your finances **do not** apply to a New Testament/New Covenant church of believers today.

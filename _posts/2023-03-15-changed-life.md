## Intro
There are many Christians out there that falsely believe, teach, or claim that we do not need to live a changed life after we become born again. They say things like, "*living a changed life is trusting in yourself rather than Christ*" or "*if you believe that you need to live a changed life, you're preaching a turn-from-sin heresy*". Statements such as these prove Biblical ignorance from these Christians because they're teaching the opposite: that a person can continue living in wickedness, die in their sins, and still be saved. To new believers, this can become very confusing because there's no shortage of interpretations or opinions out there regarding how Christians should conduct themselves. But let's not forget: "God is not the author of confusion (1st Corinthians 14:33)." As with anything, let's examine the Bible and see what the Scriptures have to say on this topic.

## A License to Sin?
Most of the opponents of living a changed life are typically those of the [hyper-grace](https://www.gotquestions.org/hyper-grace.html) movement. They believe you can live like the devil and still be saved. So long as you "*prayed the [sinner's prayer](https://www.exagora.me/heresy/a-dangerous-prayer/)*," you're good to continue living in sin because all sin is covered through Christ's atonement; there's no need to confess our sin (1st John 1:9) or repent.

Unfortunately for hyper-gracers, this couldn't be further from the truth. But before we dive into Scripture, let's ask ourselves a question: *why would we **want** to continue sinning after we become saved?* Think about that. There's no excuse for this other than a continued desire to sin. Do they love their sin more than they love Christ? If you never attempt to add to your faith, you become at risk of becoming spiritually blind and stagnant (2nd Peter 1:5-9). Those that have become stagnant have not added love to their faith. If we claim that we love Jesus, we will keep His commandments (John 14:15). If our love for the Lord is little, then maybe we have been forgiven of little (Luke 7:47) and need reminded what we were saved from? 

### Scripture Says...
#### We're Saved From Sin
We have been saved from our sins:

> <u>Matthew 1:21</u>: She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.

If we are His people, and we've been saved from our sins, then how can we assume we should continue doing the very things we were saved from?

> <u>Romans 6:1-4,7</u>:<br>
> **1** What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <br>
> **2** By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <br>
> **3** Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <br>
> **4** We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.<br>
> **7** For one who has died has been set free from sin. 

Verse 2 above is very telling is it not? We are dead to sin. Therefore, we should no longer live in it. If we are truly set apart, we should be zealous to do good works as born-again Christians (Titus 2:14 and 1st Peter 2:9). But it's not performing good works to boast or brag or even to obtain salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9), but because God prepared us to walk in good works after we are saved (Ephesians 2:10)! 

We are set free from sin, and have become slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:18). This being the case, wouldn't it be safe to assume that righteous living through a changed life and being careful to maintain good works for Christ (Titus 3:8) is what we should strive for as born again believers? It's what the Bible teaches.

#### We're New Creatures
If we claim to be Christians, we are new creatures (2nd Corinthians 5:17). As new creatures, we are commanded to put off the old self and put on the new self (Colossians 3:5-10 and Ephesians 4:22-24). This new life we now live is for Christ because He gave Himself for us (Galatians 2:20 and 2nd Corinthians 5:15). We are told to be careful how we walk and to not waste time, but make the best use of it in our walk with the Lord (Ephesians 5:15-17). Why, as new creatures living for Christ, would we want to continue in sin? I'm not saying we won't stumble along the path into sin--we're human--what I am saying is, instead of writing off sin, accepting it into our lives, and allowing ourselves to become slaves to sin (John 8:34) through repetition *because* "we're human," why don't we believe we can do all things in Christ because He strengthens us (Philippians 4:13)? We can have Jesus aid us in our victory against sin (1st Corinthians 15:55-57)!

Are we truly following Christ if we profess to know Him, but are not showing the work or fruit to prove it? The book of Titus says that we deny Him in this case (Titus 1:16); we're abominable and disobedient! If you claim to be a new creature in Christ, wake up to righteousness (1st Corinthians 15:34)! I am speaking to myself just as much as anyone reading this. If your faith has no fruit and provides no works, what type of faith even is it (James 2:17-18)? The book of James says that type of faith is dead. I know there were many times in my walk in Christ that I could have done better. I did things I *knew* I shouldn't have done. What about you? Are you excusing it like I used to do, or are you willing to repent and put your old self away? As Christians, we're not called to continue in sin and live as our old former selves. We are new creatures. Let's start acting as such.

## Early Church Beliefs
I'm not one to esteem man in his position of opinion or interpretation of Scripture. But at the end of the day, we have to remember certain of these men were inspired to write their epistles--since all scripture is given by inspiration of God (2nd Timothy 3:16). For some of these men like Paul, Peter, and John, we have 1st and 2nd century men in the Church who studied amongst them. Some of those men include Clement of Rome, Barnabas, Polycarp, and Ignatius--among others. So, what did these men think of living a changed life after becoming born again?

  * **Clement of Rome**
    > "It is necessary, therefore, that we be prompt in the practice of good works. For He forewarns us, 'Behold, the Lord comes and His reward is before His face, to render to every man according to his work.' Let us therefore earnestly strive to be found in the number of those who wait for Him, in order that we may share in His promised reward. But how, beloved ones, shall we do this? By fixing our thoughts on God by faith. By earnestly seeking the things that are pleasing and acceptable to Him. By doing the things that are in harmony with His blameless will. And by following the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and sin."

  * **Justin Martyr**
    > "Eternal fire was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God and for all who, without repentance, persevere in apostasy." -- A.D. 156 (fragment in Irenaeus, Against Heresies 5:26)

  * **Ignatius**
    > "...that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that you are indeed the members of His Son. ...faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. ...the tree is made manifest by its fruit. So those who profess themselves to be Christians will be recognized by their conduct. ...it is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk and not be one." -- A.D. 105


## Conclusion
As born-again believers, we are called "new creatures." How can we, being these new creatures, expect to live like our old selves and still profess we know Jesus, yet in our works we deny Him? We are not granted a license to sin after we become saved, why do we believe that we can live in constant, unrepentant, persistent sin and still claim the name of Jesus? This is a heresy that is not found in Scripture, was not taught or believed by the early church, and will doom many to Hell because they are denying Jesus by their fruit and actions. If we say we love the Lord, yet do not abide in Him or keep His commandments, what does that profit us? Why were saved to begin with? If we were saved from our sins, we shouldn't be expected to continue to live in them and still be saved. We are new creatures in Christ. So let's put off our old self, and put on the new self.

## Intro
This post is going to be a little more raw than anything I've posted before. I'm a very private person and I don't enjoy getting into my struggles with others--let alone people on the internet I've never met before. Regardless of that, I am praying that my story can help even just one person out there to get right with God. I think this is such an important topic that is plaguing Christianity today and what plagued me for many years. This problem, though, is nothing new and was written about throughout the Bible. And it's that of complacency. The main passage that I want to examine in light of this topic is from [Hebrews 6:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206%3A11-12&version=ESV), but I will attempt to bring more Scripture in to shed additional light onto this very important topic. I pray this will be an encouragement to you if you've struggled with complacency or if you're currently struggling with complacency in your walk with the Lord. And my hope is that this may not cause those in complacency to remain in complacent Christian living. Just remember: there's always hope in Him and you can overcome your complacency through the power of Christ!

## What Do I Mean by Complacency? 
### Definition
The Oxford dictionary defines complacency as, "*a feeling of smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements*." Or, as I like to call it, a "lazy pride." Applying this to our Christian lives, we become lazy in critiquing our walk with the Lord or examining ourselves [(2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 13:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=ESV). 

### A Simple Illustration
Let me use a simple illustration to describe what I mean. When I was in the Marine Corps, the most common phrase they drilled into our heads when referring to combat and deployments was, "*complacency kills*." The idea of this is quite simple: *if you let your guard down, then you're dead*. Complacency can range from a lack of alertness to getting lazy and anything in between. Imagine being on a deployment and you're patrolling the same area every day. What if the enemy catches onto this and notices you've become predictable? Maybe you start and end at the exact same times every day. Maybe your route never changes.  

### A Deeper Examination
You see, the Christian life is very similar to combat. In our own patrol--or walk with the Lord--we can just as easily go with the motions and get sluggish. And just as dangerously, the enemy catches on. There is very good reason Paul likened the faith to war or combat in Ephesians chapter 6. We are in a spiritual battle in the enemy's territory and must equip ourselves with the full [armor of God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206%3A10-18&version=KJV) if we want to withstand the devil's schemes. That armor includes (i.) the belt of truth, (ii.) the breastplate of righteousness, (iii.) shoes prepared with the readiness of the gospel, (iv.) the shield of faith, (v.) the helmet of salvation, (vi.) and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Imagine not equipping yourself with just one of these pieces of armor. You won't be nearly as ready to defeat the enemy! Once we start taking off pieces of this armor, we are greatly putting ourselves at risk for attack and we've become complacent and sluggish in our faith. I used the word `sluggish` because that's the word that Hebrews 6:12 uses in the first passage that I want to talk about. 

> <u>Hebrews 6:11-12</u>:<br>
> **11** And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end, <br>
> **12** so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

The King James Version uses the word `slothful` in place of sluggish, but they have the same meaning. The Greek word for `slothful` is "[nōthros](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3576/kjv/tr/0-1/)," which is translated:

> I. slow, sluggish, indolent, dull, languid

It literally means *to be lazy*. Use that passage to examine yourself. Do you read your Bible, do you consistently pray, do you have a desire to walk in obedience to Him? Or are you going with the motions? Are you lazy? 

## Where We Get Complacent
### In Reading the Word
I would argue the first area we get complacent as Christians is in reading the Bible. This is the easiest place to *go with the motions* which causes us to get sluggish. For example, I have always read my Bible even when I got sluggish in my walk with the Lord. But what I noticed was, it wasn't that I *was* reading the Bible, it was *how* I was reading the Bible. And this was a problem. I remember **many** times where I would be reading the Bible where I would flip to Psalms and just read 1 or 2 Psalms and call that good. And generally, it was always the shorter ones every single time. "Well, I read the Bible!" But did I? Was my heart truly in it? No, I was very lazy in reading His Word. I was reading the Bible in a prideful or Pharisaical manner. I was reading it just to read it without studying it or wanting to be moved by it. It was complacency because, like the Oxford definition I used earlier says, it was done so in a smug and uncritical satisfaction with my achievement of just reading the Bible. I got complacent in reading the Word. 

### In Idols
The Bible has a lot to say about idols. Sadly, Christians today as well as most preachers do not preach against the sin of idolatry anymore. Have we become so complacent or ignorant to believe that idols no longer exist? We have *much more* idols in our society and world today than those of the ancient days. Once we start putting things in front of Christ, our heart will turn from Him to what we put in place of Him. Idolatry is usually a sin of self-service or self-gratification. It can be anything that we devote more time on than time devoted to God. I like to think of it with a question: "*where are you spending your time*?" Is that idol in your life sports, TV, work, a relationship, your own dreams, video games, etc.? Obviously, idols are not just confined to these few things. What you must do is be honest with yourself. What in your life has become more important than Christ?  

A big idol for me in my early walk with Christ was my work and my own dreams and aspirations. I was laser focused on my own career than of things pertaining to God. I remember when I landed my dream job at my dream company and still feeling like something was missing. I was happy, but I didn't feel as content as I thought I would have. Having spent literal **years** trying to get to where I was, I thought I would be much happier. And there's a reason for that which I realized much later on. I was spending more time on myself and my career than in my faith in Jesus. There's so much more to life than serving ourselves. We are called to love God and to love others ([Matthew 22:37-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=ESV), [John 15:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A12&version=ESV), [Galatians 5:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205%3A13&version=ESV), [Romans 12:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A10&version=ESV)). We are called to do good works [(Ephesians 2:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A10&version=ESV). Contrary to the false gospels of the [Word of Faith](https://www.compellingtruth.org/word-faith.html) movement or [Prosperity Gospel](https://www.gotquestions.org/prosperity-gospel.html) of today, we are not called to love ourselves and serve ourselves. I certainly was not doing any of these things to the best of my ability. 

Another idol that I noticed I was spending *way* too much time at was playing video games. This went on for many, many years. But it wasn't until my wife got sick with cancer in July 2021 where I started to realize how much time we have on this earth and how much of that time that I was wasting. And even when I was struck with this terrifying realization, I noticed myself escaping my reality in these little virtual worlds in video games more so than running to God. Sure, I prayed harder than I ever have in my life, I fasted, I changed a lot of things, and I supported my wife throughout her battle, but none of that mattered. She passed away in June 2022. I wasted **SO** much time. Time that I'll never, ever get back. These are things I deeply regret to this day. And rightfully so. I could have been so much better. So much better in my walk with the Lord in serving Him and so much better as a spiritual leader to my wife. We all can be better in removing idols in our lives. But let's not wait until tragedy strikes like I did. Time is too short, but there's a sort of beauty in that: this moment right now is not too late. Turn from your idols and turn to God. Be honest with yourself. Where are you spending your time?  

### In Allowing Sin
The worst way we can get complacent in our Christian walk is by allowing sin in our lives. Sin is serious. Sin has consequences. The weak version of Christianity today tells us that we can't out-sin God's grace. Even if we could live in constant, unrepentant, unconfessed sin before the Lord, why even try? Does that not show where our hearts are? Jesus said that whoever sins is a slave to it [(John 8:34)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A34&version=NKJV). How can we expect to be called a child of God if we're practicing sin [(1<sup>st</sup> John 3:7-8)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A7-8&version=ESV) by constantly living in it? For me, I am ashamed to admit I let some stupid things back into my life over the course of years. Things that I would justify. Things that I would say, "everyone struggles with sin." I abused God's grace. Is that what you're doing today? Think of sin right now that may be in your life. Have you become so complacent that it's part of you now? Repent and turn that over to God! Sin is like a weed. When we first notice it, we think it's too small and therefore not of much concern. But before we know it, it grows rapidly and will choke out other plants while shooting its roots deeper and deeper into the soil, making it harder to uproot the longer it grows. No matter how small you think a sin may be, it may not always be that way. Just like a weed, sin grows rapidly and sin spreads. Take care of it immediately. 

## How To Combat Complacency
### (1.) Be Vigilant
If we are to combat complacency, we must be alert. The Bible says to be sober-minded and vigilant as the devil roams around seeking whom he may devour [(1<sup>st</sup> Peter 5:8)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205%3A8&version=NKJV). This is you. This is me. It starts with being honest with yourself. Is there a sin in your life that you need to get rid of? Are you serving God to the best of your ability? Are you reading your Bible? The list goes on but think of areas of your Christian walk with the Lord where you might be getting sluggish, slack, or lazy. If you're not making conscious efforts of examining yourselves [(2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 13:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=ESV), then you're losing out on potential opportunities to see sluggishness before it turns into complacency. 

### (2.) Read the Bible
> <u>2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 3:16-17</u>:<br>
> **16** All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
> **17** That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

The interesting thing about the above passage is how verse 17 is directly linked to verse 16 through a colon. The word `that` points back to `scripture`, so we can summarize that passage to mean: God's inspired Word, properly used and applied, provides us all we need for life and our walk with the Lord. We can take this a step further and assume if we're not reading His Word, we're not equipped to believe the right things (**...for doctrine**), we won't know what is wrong (**...for reproof**), we won't know how to correct wrong (**...for correction**), we won't know how to live properly (**...for instruction in righteousness**), and we won't have everything needed to do what God wants us to do (**...perfect**, Greek word "[artios](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g739/kjv/tr/0-1/)", meaning *fitted, complete; proficient, capable*). 

### (3.) Add to Your Faith
In [2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 1:5-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A5-10&version=NKJV), Peter tells us to add to our faith these things:

 * virtue
 * knowledge
 * self-control
 * perseverance
 * godliness
 * brotherly kindness
 * love

Peter actually doesn't mention adding these things to faith, but *building* them on top of each other. "*Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue, knowledge...*" I like to think of it like building a pizza. If faith is our dough, would it be a good pizza if we add all of the ingredients to the dough and threw the whole ball into the oven? It sure wouldn't resemble a pizza and wouldn't taste as good. We must do the same to our faith, which is what Peter is teaching us. Take our dough and knead it, add the sauce to the dough, add the cheese to the sauce, add the rest of the ingredients on the cheese, and then our pizza will come out looking and tasting like a pizza. 

Peter says if we do add those things to our faith, then several more things will happen:
 
 * we won't be barren
 * we won't be unfruitful
 * we will never stumble

It is crucial that we add to our faith as this is the only way we can grow. We cannot grow if we become stagnant, sluggish, and lazy. This will only lead us to becoming barren, unfruitful, and cause us to stumble into complacency. 

### (4.) Be Led by the Spirit
Lastly, walk by the Spirit [(Galatians 5:16)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+5%3A16&version=ESV). If we do, we won't satisfy the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh creep in and can ensnare us, making us complacent and turning our hearts away from the Lord. Listen to the Spirit when you feel moved to do something. 

* "**You've wasted a lot of time today, what have you done for God?**"
* "**You shouldn't gossip about them behind their back.**"
* "**Is drinking and partying something a Christian should be doing?**"

These are things we need to be listening to if we're to combat complacency. The easiest way to distinguish if that little voice in our head is the Holy Spirit is by asking yourself: *does this align with Scripture and what God's will is?* If the answer is "yes," do not quench the Spirit, but take care of the task immediately.

## Conclusion
Complacency is defined as, "*a feeling of smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements*." This is so easy to do in our Christian walk. We become complacent when we become satisfied and uncritical of ourselves. Or, as Hebrews 6:12 mentions, sluggish. Being sluggish will lead to complacency. Some areas as Christians where we become complacent is in reading the Bible, idols in our lives, or through the acceptance of sin into our lives. Just because we've become sluggish, though, does not mean there's no hope for us. We can combat complacency in our Christian walk by being vigilant and alert. We need to examine ourselves and be honest with ourselves if we want to be right with God. It all starts there. A second way we can combat complacency is by reading the Bible. This may seem obvious, but a wonderful passage in 2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 3:16-17 tells us just how important Scripture is. Lastly, being led by the Spirit is another way how we can combat complacency. If we get feelings or thoughts telling us to do something (or **not** to do something) and it aligns clearly with Scripture, we should not quench the Spirit [(1<sup>st</sup> Thessalonians 5:19)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205%3A19&version=ESV), but listen and obey. I hope this was an encouragement to you and that you can take something away from this. But I urge you to examine your own walk, be honest with yourself, and get right with God if you're living as a complacent Christian.

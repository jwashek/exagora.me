## Intro
If God is God, can we really know Him? After all, wouldn't the Creator of the universe be too much for our human minds to comprehend? Certain aspects, maybe, but the Bible does say that *God is love*, which is the first hint we should take to heart if we're to better understand Him. His Word also says that whoever loves, knows God (1 John 4:7) and whoever loves God is known by God (1 Corinthians 8:3). Those are very powerful Scriptures which give us but a glimpse into God's character. But I think we can use the key to all those passages--which is `love`--to understand God even more. This is vitally important for our Christian walk as this will not only increase our love for God but will aid us in showing more love to others as well.

## God Is Love
> <u>1 John 4:8</u> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

The second part of the above verse is what I want to spend time focusing on, *God is love*. This is crucial because it's the first piece of the puzzle to better understanding God. A natural question to this statement might be, "*if God is love, what exactly is love?*" In other words, what are some qualities of love and how can we know what love looks like? It's a question I've posed to myself many times. But here's the beauty of the Bible. You can read a passage 1,000 times and gloss over other parts of the Bible that might be better equipped at explaining your question for you. And it's there where God reveals the dynamic nature of His Word! 

### If God Is Love...
This leads me to 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. A very common passage that you've likely heard a dozen times depending on how many weddings you've attended. It's very often called the *Love Passage*, and rightfully so.

> <u>1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 13:4-8</u>:<br>
> **4** Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant<br>
> **5** or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;<br>
> **6** it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.<br>
> **7** Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>
> **8** Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.

So, this begs the question, "*can we just replace `love` with `God` in the verses above?*" I think so, and we can come to a reasonable conclusion of this if we examine each sub-point with Scripture.

**God is patient and kind** We see this in many passages such as Nehemiah 9:17, Psalm 36:7, and Psalm 63:3, but my favorite tends to be that of 2 Peter 3:9.<br>
**God does not envy or boast; God is not arrogant or rude** Since there aren't really verses speaking on this as it relates to God, we can use Jesus as our example. And what better example for Jesus said, "I and my Father are one (John 10:30)." Therefore, we see Jesus as a humble servant (Matthew 20:28 and Philippians 2:8) which is very often used to describe His character and is one quality that we cannot see boasting or arrogance in.<br>
**God does not insist on His own way; God is not irritable or resentful** We are given free will to choose to walk in the light or in darkness (1 John 1:6-7). God is not irritable since He is slow to anger (Psalm 103:3). Typically, `love` is seen as an antonym to resentment and we can conclude that since God is love, God is not resentful.<br>
**God does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth** God hates sin (Proverbs 6:16-19, Psalm 5:5, and Psalm 45:7), but rejoices when even just one sinner comes to repentance (Luke 15:7).<br>
**God bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things; God never ends** We can safely assume God bears all things since He's the Creator of all things; likewise, He believes all things because He knows His creation and what He created. And since God is love, love has been here before the world began and much before we ever stepped foot onto it (2 Peter 3:8, Psalm 90:2, and Psalm 90:4).<br>

## Loving Father
Probably the most common reference for God that's used in the Bible is that of a father (2 Corinthians 6:18). In Matthew 6:9, Jesus taught the disciples to pray in the manner of, "*Our Father in heaven...*" Many more times, the Bible mentions God being a loving father and compares Him to our earthly fathers (Matthew 6:26 and Matthew 7:11). But sadly, I don't think we give this much more thought than just a few verses. Relating God to something like that of a father shows us some amazing things. An earthly father loves their children in many ways, and we see God loving us with compassion (Psalm 103:13), patience (2 Peter 3:9), mercy and comfort (2 Corinthians 1:3-4), discipline (Hebrews 12:7-11), dependability (Matthew 10:29-31), and protection (Psalm 139:5). 

### Prodigal Son
I think many Christians today have an incorrect view of God that we must be always sinlessly perfect, without fail, and have unwavering obedience. As children, we stumble and are imperfect. But if our earthly fathers were patient with us when we stumbled and were imperfect, wouldn't God have much more grace and mercy than they? God certainly knows us in a way that our earthly fathers never can (Psalm 44:21). Maybe the most beautiful answer to this question is found in Luke 15:11â€“32 with the story of the Prodigal Son. A story most of us have heard dozens of times, no doubt, but a very important story for us to better understand God's relationship to us as a Father. The story goes, a son took an inheritance from his father and spent that money in reckless living. He felt remorse and sorrow for his ways and went to go plead his father's forgiveness and ask that he would just allow him to become a hired servant. But as the son was coming home, when the father saw him from far away, he ran to him with compassion and embraced him in full acceptance. Instead of having him as a hired servant as the son was planning to request, the father clothed him with the best robe and killed a fatted calf for them to eat in celebration of his return. 

### Two Sons
We see another beautiful picture of obedience in the parable of the two sons in Matthew 21:28-32. The story goes, a father tells his two sons to work in the vineyard. The one son says, "I will not," but changes his mind and goes to the vineyard. The other son says, "I will go," but did not. Jesus then asks which of the two sons did the will of the father? The obvious answer is that of the first son who said he would not go but did.

### Obedient Children
We can, and very often do, not obey to the best of our abilities. God will reward a sincere heart in obedience. But this heart may not always be in perfect submission. Just as our children **will** disobey and we do not cast them aside, God is much more patient and long-suffering than us. Do you want to be obedient with a sincere heart? God knows this and searches our hearts and is just and merciful enough to reward us accordingly (Jeremiah 17:10). Let us always strive to obey the Lord and keep His commandments through obedience--and they're not burdensome (1 John 5:3 and 1 John 3:23-24)--as doing so will allow us to abide in Him and His love will perfect itself within us (1 John 4:12-13). And what more, as His children, could we ask for than that? For this alone will help us to better love God and love others.

## Conclusion
God is love. That powerful verse in 1 John 4:8 helps us by unlocking our mind to who God really is. From those three words alone, we can draw many comparisons to the nature and character of God. The famous passage in 1st Corinthians 13, often called the *Love Passage*, is one such comparison. Paul uses `love` in many different contexts and shows us a better understanding of love in that passage of Scripture. And since "*God is love*," then we can assume a mere replacement of `love` with `God` in that passage can suffice for a starting level of understanding of who God really is. In addition to this, we looked at love in a different context--a loving father--and showed how God not only fits this description, but far exceeds it. I hope that after reading this post, you have a renewed sense of how to love God and love others by better understanding just one word: love.

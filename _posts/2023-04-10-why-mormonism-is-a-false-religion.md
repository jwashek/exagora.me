## Intro
Mormon claim the Book of Mormon is the real word of God and they claim that it's more correct than the Bible. We'll break down and examine many claims in the Book of Mormon and prove this to be incorrect. In so doing, I will show how Mormonism is a false religion and cannot be trusted as true. Some of the points in the Book of Mormon I want to examine include its geography, lack of arcaheological evidence, and prophets. 

## Book of Mormon Brief Summary
### Statement
Mormons believe the Bible is a historical account of the old world, but the Book of Mormon is a historical account of the Americas--the New World. This very brief statement will be *crucial* as we go forward in proving Mormonism as a false, made-up religion. But before I get into that, let's take a high level view of what the Book of Mormon teaches.

### Before Christ
Hundreds of years B.C., a group of people named the Jaredites migrated to the New World and, centuries later, they had a massive civil war and completely destroyed themselves. So much so that over 2 million Jaredites lost their lives at a battle on the hill of Cumorah, which is present day New York.

### After Christ
Jesus Christ, in roughly A.D. 34, visited the Nephites and Lamanites in the Americas following His death, burial, and resurrection. This brought hundreds of years of peace between the rivaling and constantly warring clans of the Nephites and Lamanites. This peace did not last, however. Another battle ocurred at the hill Cumorah where the Lamanites completely wiped out the Nephites save one man, Moroni. 

Moroni returned 1400 years later as an angel to Jospeh Smith, Jr. Then Moroni told Joeseph Smith that there was a book written on gold plates about the former inhabitants of the Americas. Joeseph Smith found that gold plated book on the hill Cumorah. He then translated it and published it in the year 1830. 

## Proving the Errors
### Geography
#### Book of Mormon
Mormons use illustrated maps which do not agree with one another, but what's worse, they don't even correspond with any real land masses on earth in most cases. There is no real-world setting that accounts for the geography found in the Book of Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ("LDS Church") takes no official stance on the geography, and one of the reasons for this is due to the simple fact that a distortion would need to occur in either the texts or the earth itself.

#### The Bible
In sharp contrast, the Bible mentions geographical locations such as the Jordan River, Sea of Galilee, Dead Sea, Mt. Hermon, Mt. Sinai, etc. by using the exact same terminology for housands of years. The geography matches. These places, cities, rivers, and valleys in the Bible can be traced with highly accurate and detailed accounts in Scripture.

### Archaeology
#### Book of Mormon
Lamanites, in the Book of Mormon, were called a remnant of the house of Israel. They migrated from Jerusalem to the Americas in ~600 B.C. (according to the Book of Mormon). However, no arcaeological evidence has been found to this day that these were a real people or existed in the Americas. Even more interesting, there have been zero traces of ancient Hebrew writings, texts, or other remnants or artifacts left behind within the Americas. Tombs, temples, houses, and other destroyed artifacts should be left behind with hundreds upon hundreds of years of settlement.

Do you recall earlier when I mentioned millions died in a massive civil war on the hill Cumorah (modern day New York)? There has been **zero** proof of a battle at this scale which occurred in the area since there are no mass burial sites, skeletal remains, or remnant weapons left behind in the surrounding area. 

#### The Bible
The Bible has been higly established through archaeology throughout history. It is evident of marks being left behind from written records, coins, structures, and other artifacts still being unearthed to this day. Alternatively, the Bible mentions known cities and areas such as Jerusalem, Jericho, Bethlehem, and Nazareth. These are all verifiable cities and locations unlike "Zarahemla" or "Bountiful" mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

### Plants and Animals
#### Book of Mormon
In 1<sup>st</sup> Nephi 18:25, it states:

> ...there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cows and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat

In 2<sup>nd</sup> Nephi 12:7, it states:

> ...the land is also full of horses...

In Mosiah 9:9, it states:

> And we began to till the ground... seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat and of barley

We would expect to find evidence in the Americas of the types of plants and animals mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Instead, we find turkeys, dogs, deer; corn, beans, squash, etc. What we see in the Book of Mormon is all the wrong plants and animals that do not align with ancient America. Traces of wheat, barley, cattle, sheep, goats, and certainly horses were completely absent in the Americas in the times mentioned in the Book of Mormon. 

#### The Bible
The Bible mentions animals and plants which align directly with the geographical location except minor differences in animals that no longer roam the lands like lions. However, in cases such as these, there are writings from explorers from centuries ago that have spoken of lions existing within the land at those times. Though they might not exist today, they did in antiquity at one point. 

### Manuscripts
#### Book of Mormon
The Book of Mormon mentioned the Nephites to be a culture with writing. This can be observed in Helaman 3:15:

> But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.

Now, if the Nephites were a culture of writers, where are the records? Where are the manuscripts? There is no historical or archaeological trace that can be pointed to the Nephites or any other culture, event, society, or city mentioned in the Book of Mormon.

And let's take this a step further. Events in the Book of Mormon are said to have ended in 400 A.D. And the **only** evidence we have is the Book of Mormon itself, some 1430 years later? This is not even improbable that a book containing this much history has not a single trail of verifiable, documented trace. It's impossible. If this is the case, would this not assume the book itself was constructed in the 19<sup>th</sup> century?

#### The Bible
The earliest known part of the Bible to have been preserved is from the book of Numbers and came from the 7<sup>th</sup> century B.C. Additionally, the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947. These scrolls confirm **every** single book of the Old Testament (except the book of Esther). These scrolls date all the way back to the 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C.

There are several thousand manuscripts which contain books of the Bible or parts of those books that archaeologists have found throughout the centuries. The overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the Bible cannot be understated. No other book in *history* has the amount of evidence supporting it than that of the Bible.

### Language
#### The Book of Mormon
In Mormon 9:32, it mentions that the Nephites used "reformed Egyptian" in America. The problem with this is, linguists, other than the LDS Church, don't even know what this language is or was--because it is a fictional language. There is not a single trace of ancient Hebrew or Egyptian hieroglyphs found in America.

#### The Bible
On the contrary, the Bible has plentiful evidence suggesting the language of Hebrew was used within the time period of the Bible stayed true to the claims. There are no archaelogists, scholars, or linguists that have attempted to refute this claim.

### Prophecy
In Deutoronomy x:x, it states:
> <u>Deutoronomy x:x</u>: xyz

This will be important going forward, so I want you to keep this verse in the back of your mind.

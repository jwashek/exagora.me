## TL;DR
Mormonism is often said to be under the umbrella of Christianity; however, this couldn't be further from the truth. Mormonism is a heresy and follows "another Jesus."

## Book of Mormon Brief Summary
Mormons believe the Bible is a historical account of the old world, but the Book of Mormon is a historical account of the Americas--the New World. This will be *crucial* as we go forward in proving Mormonism as a false, made-up religion with another Jesus. But before I get into that, let's take a high-level view of what the Book of Mormon teaches.

### Before Christ
Hundreds of years B.C., a group of people named the Jaredites migrated to the New World and, centuries later, they had a massive civil war and completely destroyed one another. So much so that over 2 million Jaredites lost their lives at a battle on the hill of Cumorah, which is in present day New York.

### After Christ
Jesus Christ, in roughly A.D. 34, visited the Nephites and Lamanites in the Americas following His death, burial, and resurrection. This brought hundreds of years of peace between the rivaling and constantly warring clans of the Nephites and Lamanites. This peace did not last, however. Another battle occurred at the hill Cumorah where the Lamanites completely wiped out the Nephites save one man, Moroni. 

Moroni returned 1400 years later as an angel to Joseph Smith, Jr. Then Moroni told Joseph Smith that there was a book written on gold plates about the former inhabitants of the Americas. Joseph Smith found that gold plated book on the hill Cumorah. He then translated it and published it in the year 1830 as "*The Book of Mormon*". 

## Proving the Errors
### Geography
#### The Book of Mormon
One of the easiest ways to prove Mormonism as false is with their made-up geographical locations. Mormons use illustrated maps which do not agree with one another, but what's worse, they don't even correspond with any real land masses on earth in most cases. There is no real-world setting that accounts for the geography found in the Book of Mormon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ("LDS Church") takes no official stance on the geography, and one of the reasons for this is due to the simple fact that a distortion would need to occur in either the texts or the earth itself. Look for yourself at some of the images Mormons claim in their geography:

![map1](/images/bom-map1.jpg)
![map2](/images/bom-map2.png)
![map3](/images/bom-map3.jpg)

> __Note:__ Some of the land masses, like in the first picture, don't align with earth's geography *whatsoever*. But in the ones that do, such as the second and third pictures, there is no evidence that places such as Zarahemla, Bountiful, or the Land of Desolation occurred in history. And what's more, compare the first photo with the second and the third. See for yourself how they don't align.

#### The Bible
In sharp contrast, the Bible mentions geographical locations such as the Jordan River, Sea of Galilee, Dead Sea, Mt. Hermon, Mt. Sinai, etc. By using the same terminology for thousands of years, we can pinpoint exact locations mentioned in the Bible with precision since many of them are still called the very same thing in our modern day. The geography matches. These places, cities, rivers, and valleys in the Bible can be traced with highly accurate and detailed accounts in Scripture due to the unchanging geography.

### Archaeology
#### The Book of Mormon
Lamanites, in the Book of Mormon, were called a remnant of the house of Israel. They migrated from Jerusalem to the Americas in ~600 B.C. (according to the Book of Mormon). However, no archaeological evidence has been found to this day that these were a real people or existed in the Americas. And if these Lamanites migrated from Israel, why haven't traces of the Hebrew language or Jewish culture ever have been found in the Americas? There have been zero traces of ancient Hebrew writings, texts, or other remnants or artifacts left behind within the Americas. Tombs, temples, houses, and other destroyed artifacts should have been left behind with hundreds upon hundreds of years of settlement in the Americas--that is, if the claims were actually true.

Do you recall earlier the Book of Mormon's claim of a massive civil war in modern-day New York (on the hill Cumorah)? There isn't a shred of proof that a battle at this scale occurred in New York. The area contains no trace of mass burial sites, skeletal remains, or remnant weapons left behind. Nothing has been found during excavations done by the LDS Church either. 

#### The Bible
On the contrary, the Bible has been highly established through archaeology throughout history. It is evident of marks being left behind from written records, manuscripts, coins, structures, and other artifacts that are still being unearthed to this day. Alternatively, the Bible mentions known cities and areas such as Jerusalem, Jericho, Bethlehem, and Nazareth. These are all verifiable cities and locations unlike "Zarahemla" or "Bountiful" mentioned in the Book of Mormon which have no supporting evidence through historical or archaeological records.

### Plants and Animals
#### Book of Mormon
In 1st Nephi 18:25, it states:

> ...there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cows and the ox, and **the ass and the horse**, and **the goat and the wild goat**.

In 2nd Nephi 12:7, it states:

> ...the land is also **full of horses**...

In Mosiah 9:9, it states:

> And we began to till the ground... seeds, with seeds of corn, and of **wheat and of barley**.

We would expect to find evidence in the Americas of the types of plants and animals mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Instead, we find turkeys, dogs, deer; corn, beans, squash, etc. What we see in the Book of Mormon is all the wrong plants and animals that do not align with ancient America. Traces of wheat, barley, cattle, sheep, goats, and horses were completely absent in the Americas in the times mentioned in the Book of Mormon. 

#### The Bible
The Bible mentions animals and plants which align directly with the geographical location except minor differences in animals that no longer roam the lands such as lions. However, in cases such as this, there are writings from explorers from centuries ago that have spoken of lions existing within the land at those times. Though they might not exist today, they did in antiquity at one point. 

### Manuscripts
#### Book of Mormon
The Book of Mormon mentioned the Nephites to be a culture with writing. This can be observed in Helaman 3:15:

> But behold, **there are many books and many records of every kind**, and they have been **kept chiefly by the Nephites**.

Now, if the Nephites were a culture of writers, where are the writings? Where are the manuscripts? There is no historical or archaeological trace that can be pointed to the Nephites, or any other culture, event, society, or city mentioned in the Book of Mormon. How is this possible for a culture who had *many records of every kind*? 

And let's take this a step further. Events in the Book of Mormon are said to have ended in 400 A.D. And the **only** evidence we have is the Book of Mormon itself, some 1430 years later? This is not even improbable that a book containing this much history has not a single trail of verifiable, documented trace. It's impossible.

#### The Bible
The earliest known part of the Bible to have been preserved is from the book of Numbers and came from the 7th century B.C. Additionally, the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947. These scrolls confirm **every** single book of the Old Testament (except the book of Esther). These scrolls date all the way back to the 3rd century B.C.

There are several *thousand* manuscripts which contain books of the Bible or parts of those books that archaeologists have found throughout the centuries. The overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the Bible cannot be understated. No other book in *history* has the amount of archaeological evidence supporting it than that of the Bible.

### Language
#### The Book of Mormon
In Mormon 9:32, it mentions that the Nephites used "reformed Egyptian" in America. The problem with this is, linguists (other than those from the LDS Church) have never heard of this language. There is not a single trace of ancient Hebrew or Egyptian hieroglyphs found in America, which says a lot to the debunking of this claim.

#### The Bible
On the contrary, the Bible has plentiful evidence suggesting the language of Hebrew was used within the time period of the Bible which stayed true to the claims. There are no archaeologists, scholars, or linguists that have attempted to refute this claim because the evidence is all there.

### Prophecy
This next section is going to be very important. I want you to pay close attention to the prophetic messages found in the Book of Mormon vs the Bible. Deuteronomy 18:21-22 gives us a test of a prophet. It states:
> <u>Deuteronomy 18:21-22</u>:<br>
> **21** And if you say in your heart, ‘How may we know the word that the Lord has not spoken?’— <br>
> **22** when a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the Lord has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You need not be afraid of him.

For a prophet to pass the test according to Deuteronomy chapter 18, their predictions need to come true. Simple concept, but hopefully you see its significance as we continue.

#### Book of Mormon
**The Prophet Nephi**<br>
According to the Book of Mormon, around 600 B.C., the prophet Nephi prophesied that after the 12 apostles of Christ, there would be a formation of a great and abominable church (speaking of Christianity) because parts of the gospel have been corrupted (1st Nephi chapter 13).

First, there is not a single manuscript; no ancient copies of the Book of Mormon that predate Joseph Smith that the LDS Church can produce. So how can we verify this claim as true if the only "manuscript" is the Book of Mormon itself? 

Second, if we understand [how we got our Bible](https://www.exagora.me/apologetics/how-we-got-the-bible/), one of the most important things that happened in the early Church was Christians making copies of the New Testament letters. And *lots* of them. What we have are almost 6,000 manuscript copies. Now, if we're talking about various versions or languages that are included in this? That number *drastically* increases to what scholars suggest being around 40,000 manuscripts. Forty thousand manuscripts! If all copies agree except 1 or 2 that actually *have* been corrupted, these will stick out like a sore thumb. To say the Bible has been corrupted, we would be able to verify this prophecy very easily with the thousands of manuscripts we currently have. And it's never proven to have been corrupted--on the contrary, it's only been further corroborated with later findings such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and with other archaeological finds!

The logical conclusion from here is that the prophet Nephi fails the test of a prophet according to Deuteronomy chapter 18.

**The Prophet Alma**<br>
In Alma 7:10, the prophet Alma prophesies that the Lord Jesus will be born in Jerusalem. 

However, Micah 5:2 prophesied the Lord Jesus would come from Bethlehem. Mormon scholars defend this prophecy by saying, "*Bethlehem was only 6 miles from Jerusalem, we can assume it's talking about the same place*." The problem with that is there were cities in between Bethlehem and Jerusalem, meaning if any one of those cities were mentioned by Alma, wouldn't we have the same problem? The problem is simple: it's *not* the same place. Think of it in terms that we might understand a little better. If you live in a city 6 miles south of another city with both having roads named "Main Street," and you're giving directions to someone to visit your home, if they visited the other city on Main Street, would they still reach your home?

Like the prophet Nephi, the prophet Alma fails the test of a prophet according to Deuteronomy chapter 18.

**"Prophet" Joseph Smith**<br>
Joseph Smith claimed the Bible was not translated properly. So, what did he do? He inserted his own prophecies in a book titled *[New Translation of the Bible by Joseph Smith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.amazon.com/Translation-Joseph-Church-Christ-Latter/dp/1417968427)*. Comparing his version and translation to the Bible, you see many, many dangerous additions. Sometimes, his translations are full pages added to the original words of the Bible. An example of what types of addition have been added can be seen in Isaiah chapter 29.

In his own translation of the book of Isaiah, Joseph Smith added prophecies about the Book of Mormon as well as himself with prophecies such as: 

> it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book

> the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall deliver the words of the book

Every single scroll of Isaiah that has been found in antiquity do not contain these words, so it's painfully obvious that these are additions to the text.

Another case shows Joseph Smith stripping the Lord Jesus of His deity in his translation of John 1:1. His version reads: 

> In the beginning was the gospel preached through the Son. And the gospel was the word, and the word was with the Son, and the Son was with God, and the Son was of God. 

And let's compare that with what the Bible says: 

> <u>John 1:1</u> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

This was a complete butchering of the original Greek in which it was translated; another case where Joseph Smith didn't just mistranslate, but intentionally mutilated the text.

Like the prophets before him in the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith fails the test of a prophet *miserably*.

#### The Bible
**Prophet Isaiah**<br>
In Isaiah 16:5, the Prophet Isaiah predicts that the Lord Jesus would come from the house of David.

The house of David was proved in an extrabiblical ancient artifact known as the [Tel Dan inscription](https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/the-tel-dan-inscription-the-first-historical-evidence-of-the-king-david-bible-story/) relatively recently (1993). There are [18 references](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?qs_version=ESV&quicksearch=son+of+david&begin=47&end=73) of the Lord Jesus being a "son of David" in the New Testament--fully aligning the prophecies of the Bible to that of which was discovered with the Tel Dan inscription.

To further expand on this point, Eusebius of Caesarea (260-340 AD), an ancient Christian historian, provides additional context in an extrabiblical manner. He was quoted of saying: 

> "*The descendants of Jude...were related to Christ Himself...were brought to the Emperor...and he asked them if they were descendants of David, and they confessed that they were.*"

**Prophet Daniel**<br>
Daniel predicts several key events at around 538 B.C. to include:

1. Messiah being killed
2. The temple being destroyed

There is a plethora of evidence for both points (1) and (2). For Daniel's prophecy of *Messiah killed*, we have very detailed accounts of this prophecy's fulfillment within the Gospel accounts from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. However, why only use the Bible when we can also use extrabiblical resources? Something that the Book of Mormon certainly doesn't have. Two of these extrabiblical resources come from Tacitus and Lucian. They are quoted as to say: 

> "*Nero fastened the guilt ... on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of ... Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome....*" -- Tacitus (56-120 AD)

> "*The Christians ... worship a man to this day – the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account.... [It] was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws.*" -- Lucian (125-180 AD) 

For the prophecy of *the temple being destroyed*, there are numerous sources proving the Romans destroyed the Jerusalem temple in 70 A.D. So much so that this point of history cannot be denied, refuted, or argued. The temple was destroyed. But what better way to view the prophecy fulfilled than seeing it right before our own eyes?

![temple-destroyed](/images/temple-destroyed.jpg)

**King David**<br>
David prophesied of the Lord Jesus' resurrection in Psalm 16:10-11:

> <u>Psalm 16:10-11</u>:<br> 
> **10** For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption<br>
> **11** You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

Keeping up with the extrabiblical theme, we can use yet another source in the non-Christian historian, Josephus which had this to say about the resurrection:

> "*About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he ... wrought surprising feats.... He was the Christ. When Pilate ...condemned him to be crucified, those who had . . . come to love him did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he appeared ... restored to life.... And the tribe of Christians ... has ... not disappeared*" -- Josephus (37-100 AD)

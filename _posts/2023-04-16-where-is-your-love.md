## Intro
Have you ever read a verse so many times and never really stopped to think if there could be a deeper application? You know, something just clicks and it opens your mind which helps you understand other Scriptures more? Well, this happened to me the other day when reading (1st Timothy 6:10). "*For the **love of money** is a root of all kinds of evils.*" For some reason, this verse really stuck in my mind for several days until I re-read 1<sup>st</sup> Peter. I noticed something interesting: verse 8 says, "*love covers a multitude of sins*." So, we have two things here: (1) love, improperly directed, *causes* sin, and (2) love, properly directed, *covers* sin. But just how does this work? 

## Directing Our Love Improperly
If we're loving the wrong things, not only will we **not** be able to cover a multitude of sins, but we'll *create* a multitude of sins for us. Where is your love?

### Loving Material Things
Are you chasing your desires or passions to have the "new thing" which never seems to be satisfied? Are you seeing the big, flashy new item that your neighbor or friend has and you just *need* it too? A new phone, new jewelry... whatever it may be. This may seem like a small thing to most, but love directed upon material things causes covetousness, envy--which can lead to other things such as anger, bitterness, resentment, hate, etc.--greed, and idolatry. All of which are very serious sins that a born-again believer needs to put to death (Romans 6:2).  

### Loving Sex
Do you love sex? Maybe an odd question, but the Bible has so much to say about sexual sins. Actually, this is one of the few sins that the Bible mentions to *flee* from [(1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 6:18)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206%3A18&version=ESV). Sure, if we name the name of the Lord, we are to depart from iniquity [(2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 2:19)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202%3A19&version=ESV), but the Bible uses very strong language against sexual sins rather than "depart." Flee means to run away from and seek safety! I like to think of this with the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Potiphar's wife wanted to lay with Joseph and he literally ran out of his own clothes, leaving them in her hands [(Genesis 39:11-12)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+39%3A11-12&version=ESV). This is how we should view sexual sin. And if you're committing sexual sin, you are committing many others to include lust, covetousness, and even idolatry [(Colossians 3:5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A5&version=ESV). Sexual immorality should not even be named among Christians [(Ephesians 5:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205%3A3&version=ESV), because those who commit such things will not inherit the kingdom of God ([1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 6:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A9-10&version=ESV), [Galatians 5:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A19-21&version=ESV), [Revelation 21:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+21%3A8&version=ESV), and [Ephesians 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A5&version=ESV)). The language used from the Word should strike fear in anyone's heart that is practicing sexual immorality, fornication, or those addicted to porn.

### Loving Ourself
Contrary to what mainstream Christianity teaches today--especially in the false gospel of the [Word of Faith](https://www.gotquestions.org/Word-Faith.html) movement--we are to not serve ourselves, but to serve others in love and humility [(Romans 12:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A10&version=ESV). We're told to count others more significant than ourselves [(Philippians 2:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A3&version=ESV) and use our gifts in serving one another [(1<sup>st</sup> Peter 4:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204%3A10&version=ESV). When we serve ourself, we tend to shut our hearts of compassion against others. And this can lead to all sorts of sin especially if it leads us away from doing the right thing [(James 4:17)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A17&version=ESV).

In addition to this, a mark of the last days is that people will become lovers of self [(2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 3:2-5)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+3%3A1-5&version=ESV). When you love yourself, you will heap to yourselves idols that are pleasing to you which turn your attention and devotion away from serving God. Not only are you serving the idols in your life, but you're committing a two-fold idolatry by becoming the very idol yourself. 

### Loving Money
The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil [(1<sup>st</sup> Timothy 6:10)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206%3A10&version=ESV). This, according to Paul's first epistle to Timothy, is a reason why many wander away from the faith. They pursue money and things that money can buy. It can be seen as somewhat cyclical to material gain as well. You love money, you love material things; you love material things, you love money because you want more material things. And not only this, but loving money can cause other much more serious sins such as gambling, greed [(1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 5:11)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%205%3A11&version=ESV), or envy. In some cases, even *more* serious sins. Take for example a recent story in which a man was [kidnapped, tortured, and held for ransom](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11865165/Belmore-kidnapping-inside-story-Peter-Vuong-bed-influencer-Angel-Bowyer.html) for $5m. See what a love of money can cause people to do? Sadly, people have committed worse sins for their love of money than this, though. In nearly all murders, it can be narrowed down to robbery (through greed, financial gain, or envy), jealousy, and vengeance[(<sup>source</sup>)](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1932/3/11/robbery-jealousy-vengeance-are-causes-of/#:~:text=Robbery%2C%20jealousy%2C%20and%20vengeance%20are,all%20murders%2C%20according%20to%20Dr.). Loving money truly is the root of all kinds of evil.

## Directing Our Love Properly
In order for our love to cover a multitude of sins, we must understand if we are loving God and loving others, we will fulfill the whole of the Law.

> <u>Matthew 22:36-40</u><br>
> **36** "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"<br> 
> **37** And he said to him, â€œYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.<br> 
> **38** This is the great and first commandment.<br> 
> **39** And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.<br> 
> **40** On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."

### Love Towards God
We will be in a right relationship with God if we're abiding in love.

Fulfill the Law by loving:

* https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202%3A8&version=ESV

### Love Towards Others
If we love others, not only do we fulfill the law as we saw in the other verses, but we'll forgive one other. In 1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 13, love is said to "*keep no record of wrongs*." We cover other's sins against us in our lives when we're willing to forgive. If God forgives us of our sins according to His love for us, how much more should we be willing to forgive others?

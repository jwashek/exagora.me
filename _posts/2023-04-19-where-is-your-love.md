## Intro
Have you ever read a verse so many times and never really stopped to think if there could be a deeper application? You know, something just clicks, and it opens your mind which helps you understand other Scriptures more? Well, this happened to me the other day when reading 1 Timothy 6:10. "*For the **love of money** is a root of all kinds of evils.*" For some reason, this verse really stuck in my mind for several days until I re-read 1st Peter. I noticed something interesting: 1 Peter 4:8 says, "*love covers a multitude of sins*." So, we have two things here: (1) love, improperly directed, *causes* sin, and (2) love, properly directed, *covers* sin. Where is your love?

## Directing Our Love Improperly
If we're loving the wrong things, not only will we **not** be able to cover a multitude of sins, but we'll *create* a multitude of sins for us. 

### Loving Material Things
Are you chasing your desires or passions to have the "new thing" which never seems to be satisfied? Are you seeing the big, flashy new item that your neighbor or friend has and you just *need* it too? A new phone, new jewelry... whatever it may be. This may seem like a small thing to most, but love directed upon material things causes covetousness, envy--which can lead to other sins such as anger, bitterness, resentment, or hate--greed, and idolatry. All of which are very serious sins that a born-again believer needs to put to death (Romans 6:2). 

### Loving Sex
Do you love sex? Maybe an odd question, but the Bible has so much to say about sexual sins. Actually, this is one of the few sins that the Bible mentions to *flee* from (1 Corinthians 6:18). Sure, if we name the name of the Lord, we are to depart from iniquity (2 Timothy 2:19), but the Bible uses very strong language against sexual sins rather than "depart." Flee means to run away from and seek safety! I like to think of this with the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Potiphar's wife wanted to lay with Joseph, and he literally ran out of his own clothes, leaving them in her hands (Genesis 39:11-12). This is how we should view sexual sin. And if you're committing sexual sin, you are committing many others to include lust, covetousness, and even idolatry (Colossians 3:5). Sexual immorality should not even be named among Christians (Ephesians 5:3), because those who commit such things will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, Revelation 21:8, and Ephesians 5:3-5). The language used from the Word should strike fear in anyone's heart that is practicing sexual immorality, fornication, or for those addicted to porn.

### Loving Ourselves
Contrary to what mainstream Christianity teaches today--especially in the false gospel of the [Word of Faith](https://www.gotquestions.org/Word-Faith.html) movement--we are to not serve ourselves, but to serve others in love and humility (Romans 12:10). We're told to count others more significant than ourselves (Philippians 2:3) and use our gifts in serving one another (1 Peter 4:10). When we serve ourselves, we tend to shut our hearts of compassion against others. And this can lead to all sorts of sin especially if it leads us away from doing the right thing (James 4:17).

In addition to this, a mark of the last days is that people will become lovers of self (2 Timothy 3:2-5). When you love yourself, you will heap to yourselves idols that are pleasing to you which turn your attention and devotion away from serving God. Not only are you serving the idols in your life, but you're committing a two-fold idolatry by becoming the very idol yourself. 

### Loving Money
The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). This, according to Paul's first epistle to Timothy, is a reason why many wander away from the faith. They pursue money and things that money can buy. It can be seen as somewhat cyclical to material gain as well. You love money, you love material things; you love material things, you love money because you want *more* material things. And not only this, but loving money can cause other much more serious sins such as swindling (basically what we would call a modern-day "scammer" or committing fraud; 1 Corinthians 5:10-11 and 1 Corinthians 6:10 for context), gambling, greed (1 Corinthians 5:11), envy, or apostasy--as the verse in 1st Timothy mentions directly. In some cases, even *more* serious sins. Take for example a recent story in which a man was [kidnapped, tortured, and held for ransom](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11865165/Belmore-kidnapping-inside-story-Peter-Vuong-bed-influencer-Angel-Bowyer.html) for $5m. See what a love of money can cause people to do? Sadly, people have committed worse sins for their love of money than this, though. In nearly all murders, it can be narrowed down to robbery (through greed, financial gain, or envy), jealousy, and vengeance[(<sup>source</sup>)](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1932/3/11/robbery-jealousy-vengeance-are-causes-of/#:~:text=Robbery%2C%20jealousy%2C%20and%20vengeance%20are,all%20murders%2C%20according%20to%20Dr.). Loving money truly is the root of all kinds of evil.

## Directing Our Love Properly
For our love to cover a multitude of sins, we must direct that love properly. And if we do, the Bible says we will fulfill the whole of the Law. In so doing, we will cover a multitude of sins!

> <u>Matthew 22:36-40</u><br>
> **36** "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"<br> 
> **37** And he said to him, â€œYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.<br> 
> **38** This is the great and first commandment.<br> 
> **39** And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.<br> 
> **40** On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."

We have two things from this passage: (1) love towards God and (2) love towards others. That's it! See how easy that is? Quite literally, love--directed in the proper way--fulfills the Law and, in turn, covers a multitude of sins.

### Love Towards God
Showing love towards God will cover a multitude of sins for two reasons. First, if we love one another, God abides in us and His love is perfected in us (1 John 4:12 and 1 John 4:16). And obviously, if God abides in us, our relationship and fellowship with Him will be in the right place which will cause us to **want** to remain in Him, be pleasing in His sight, and to not break that fellowship through sin. If we're loving and fellowshipping with Him, we won't want to offend Him by sin; we'll want to abide in Him (John 15:4). But what's more, we'll be fulfilling the whole Law by simply loving Him and loving others (Matthew 22:36-40) without even trying to do so. Second, we are proving our love for the Lord if we keep His commandments (1 John 2:3-4) because Jesus said, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments (John 14:15)." We already know that keeping the commandments is as easy as loving God and loving others as Matthew 22:36-40 and many other Scriptures point out (Romans 13:8, Romans 13:10, Galatians 5:14, and James 2:8). Therefore, being obedient in keeping the commandments to love God and to love others will cover all sin contained within the Law! 

Many Christians fear the words `obedience` or `commandment`, because they believe that inherently means "works salvation." But we are called to love because He first loved us (1 John 4:19). Though we claim to have faith, if we do not love, we are not of God (1 John 4:7-8), for love is greater than faith (1 Corinthians 13:3) and binds all other things together in perfect harmony (Colossians 3:14). This isn't teaching sinless perfection or keeping the Law to be saved. It all connects circularly back to love. How do we obey God and keep His commandments? Believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another (1 John 3:23). How do we know that we love one another? When we love God and obey His commandments (1 John 5:2-3). What are His commandments? Believing in His Son, loving God, and loving one another! See how that all works back in a circle? If you claim to believe in Jesus Christ and say that you're a follower of His, you **must** also love one another.

### Love Towards Others
If we love others, not only do we inadvertently fulfill the Law as we just saw, but we'll forgive one other which covers their sins against us. In 1 Corinthians 13:5, love is said to not be `irritable` or `resentful`. The Greek used in that passage referring to `resentful` seems to suggest it to mean "does not count up wrongdoing", or how the NIV renders it, "*[love] keeps no record of wrongs*." We cover *other's* sins against us in our lives when we're willing to forgive and not to keep records of wrongdoing against us. All this coming from one thing: love! If God, by His immeasurable grace and kindness shown to us in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:7) has forgiven us of *our* sins, how much more should we be willing to forgive others of *their* sins against us (Matthew 6:14-15)? Let's use this as an exhortation to walk in love (Ephesians 5:2) towards one another! 
 
## Conclusion
Where we direct our love tells us a lot about our lives and where we stand before God. If we love God and love others, we will fulfill all the Law and cover a multitude of sins. But directing this love properly works back in a circle: believing in the name of Jesus Christ and loving one another is how we obey God and keep the commandments. The commandments tell us to believe in Jesus, love God, and love others. Conversely, directing love elsewhere, such as on material things, sex, ourselves, or money, will cause a multitude of sins. For example, if you love money, you are more prone to commit other sins to obtain or maintain that money such as gambling, fraud, murder, or swindling/scamming. The same can be said for any other sin where we direct our love to. If you claim to be a Christian, you must love one another because that's what separates us from others and it's the very thing that allows people to know we are Christ's (John 13:35). Where is your love?

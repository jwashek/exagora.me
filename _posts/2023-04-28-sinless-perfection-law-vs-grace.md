## Intro
In the interest of not being tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4:14), let's examine one of the more prevalent heretical doctrines that causes maybe the most tossing to Christians. It's that of turning from sin or living sinless in order to be saved. There are *many* preachers that teach faith + works, but there are even many more, maybe unknowingly, that are repackaging this works-based salvation and calling it something different. That something different being "sinless perfectionism." Some of you may say, "*Isn't that the same thing?*" Well, it's not to those that are teaching sinless perfection, and here's why. Proponents of sinless perfectionism have often said they believe that you are saved through faith and not of works, but after salvation, you become sinless, and if you're not, then you're not truly saved. Which is a paradox is it not? If we are saved through faith, how do we maintain that salvation by stopping sin and keeping the Law (Galatians 3:3)? Others in the sinless perfectionism crowd take a much different route and teach that you aren't even a Christian or saved *until* you turn from all sin and live sinless, thus removing faith entirely. But what does the Bible say about sinless perfectionism?

## Quick Backstory
### Inspiration
My main inspiration of this post was hearing a preacher in a recent church I attended say, "*You're not a Christian and you're not saved until you stop sinning.*" This had me thinking of the book of Galatians: if we began our work by the Spirit through faith, how are we maintaining that by the flesh through works (Galatians 3:2-3)? Just look at that "gospel." Where is Jesus?! When do we believe and trust in Jesus Christ? Where is His atoning sacrifice (Romans 3:25)?

There are two schools of thought: (1) stopping sin **after** faith in Jesus or (2) stopping sin **before** having faith in Jesus.  

If we stop sin after having faith in Jesus, then we're shifting that trust on to ourselves to maintain salvation from our own efforts. We are no longer trusting Jesus and His death, burial, and resurrection, but ourselves in turning from sin, and thus keeping the Law (as I'll show later). If we stop sin before having faith in Jesus... well... good luck because Jesus said you will die in your sins if you don't believe in Him (John 8:24).

### What I'm Not Saying
Let me be clear before I go any further. I am **not** saying or suggesting we shouldn't turn from sin or somehow that I'm advocating for sin by rejecting the sinless perfectionism doctrine. Unfortunately, this is a strawman argument that sinless perfectionists love to pull, and I hate that I even have to put this disclaimer out here. Advocating for sin will **never** be taught by a true believer. Ever. We are exhorted in *many* New Testament passages to not sin (2 Timothy 2:19, 1 John 2:1, 1 Corinthians 15:34, John 8:34, John 8:11, 1 Thessalonians 4:3, 1 Thessalonians 5:22, 1 Peter 2:11, 1 Corinthians 6:18, 1 Corinthians 10:14, 2 Timothy 2:22, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Ephesians 5:3-5, Galatians 5:19-21, Revelation 21:8, etc.). I've written about [living a changed life](https://www.exagora.me/christianity/changed-life/) where I fully believe, if someone is truly saved, they will make conscious efforts of putting sin to death in their lives, living a life set apart and devoted to the Lord, abiding in Christ, and [loving one another](https://www.exagora.me/love/where-is-your-love/). If a Christian is convicted of sin, they *will* confess that sin, repent, and stop performing it--but not as a means of getting saved, but because we want to be pleasing to the Lord, obedient to Him, and not offend Him through sin. There's a big difference between this and the teaching of sinless perfectionism that suggests you're not even saved until you are sin free.

## Sinless Perfectionists
### Are They Keeping the Law?
In short, yes. What I hope to show here is how sinless perfection is just a reorienting of keeping the Law to be saved. The King James Version renders 1 John 3:4 (KJV) to read, "*Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.*" When we sin, we break God's Law. It's that simple. What's the easiest way to not break God's Law? Stop sinning! Therefore, sinless perfectionists inadvertently teach keeping the Law to be saved if they believe you need to live a sinless life to even be called a Christian. Regardless of when you stop sinning, i.e., either after having faith in Jesus Christ, or before having faith in Jesus Christ, the problem is the same and is described in Galatians 3:2-3. If you are holding to this teaching of sinless perfection as a means of salvation, you are holding to the teaching of keeping the Law to be saved. 

This very same problem has been around since the early church. In Acts chapter 15, certain men came from Judaea teaching that Christians needed to be circumcised in order to be saved (Acts 15:1). Once Paul and Barnabas took this to the elders in Jerusalem, Pharisees added even more to salvation by saying Christians need to keep the Law in order to be saved (Acts 15:5). Peter then stands up and debates this position by saying that the Gentiles also hear the preaching of the Gospel, believe, and have their hearts cleansed by faith (Acts 15:7-9). He finishes by asking why they're adding the burden of the Law that neither they ("they" referring to the disciples/Jews) nor their forefathers could bear (Acts 15:10-11). If Peter says he himself, everyone at the Jerusalem council, and all their forefathers since the Law came into existence could not keep the Law, then how can we be so bold to assume that we can? 

> __Note:__ The entirety of Galatians is proof against keeping the Law to be saved. Righteousness doesn't come by way of the Law, but by faith (Galatians 2:16, Romans 11:6, and Galatians 3:11). The Law's purpose was to show us our sin (Romans 3:19-20 and Galatians 3:19,21-25) until Jesus came to forgive us of our sin through faith in Him (Colossians 1:14 and Acts 10:43), take away our sin (John 1:29, Psalm 103:12, and 1 John 2:2), and nail it to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14). Why did He come to do this? So we might be reconciled to God (Romans 5:10, 2 Corinthians 5:18, and Colossians 1:22) and die to sin and live to righteousness (1 Peter 2:24-25). 

### Where Are They Getting This From?
#### "Perfect" verses such as:
* "I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect." (Genesis 17:1 (KJV))
* "Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments..." (1 Kings 8:61 (KJV)).
* "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." (Matthew 5:48)
* "Be perfect..." (2 Corinthians 13:11 (KJV)).
* "...that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus..." (Colossians 1:28 (KJV))
* "That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." (2 Timothy 3:17 (KJV))

The above verses, at first glance, seem to suggest perfection how we might consider it: flawless, sinless, faultless, and blameless. However, "perfect" in these verses do not mean any of those terms. In nearly every single case of every "perfect" verse found in the Old and New Testaments, the words translate to `complete`.  

| Root Word | Meaning/Translation | Verse(s) |
|---|---|---|
| [tāmîm](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8549/kjv/wlc/0-1/)  | "complete, whole, entire, sound; complete, whole entire; whole, sound healthful; complete, entire; sound, wholesome, unimpaired, innocent, having integrity; what is complete or entirely in accord with truth and fact."  | Genesis 17:1  |
| [šālēm](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h8003/kjv/wlc/0-1/)  | "complete, safe, peaceful, perfect, whole, full, at peace; complete, full, perfect, finished; safe, unharmed; peace, perfect, complete."  | 1 Kings 8:61  |
| [teleios](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5046/kjv/tr/0-1/)  | "brought to its end, finished; wanting nothing necessary to completeness; integrity and virtue; full grown, adult, of full age, mature."  | Matthew 5:48, 1 Corinthians 2:6, and Colossians 1:28  |
| [katartizō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2675/kjv/tr/0-1/)  | "to render, to fit, sound complete; to mend, to repair; ethically: to strengthen, perfect, complete, make one what he ought to be."  | 2 Corinthians 13:11, Hebrews 13:21, and 1 Peter 5:10  |
| [teleioō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5048/kjv/tr/0-1/)  | "to make perfect, complete; carry through completely, accomplish, finish, bring to an end; to complete, add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full, to be found perfect; to bring to an end; to accomplish, bring to a close or fulfilment by event."  | John 17:23, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Philippians 3:12, Hebrews 10:14, and Hebrews 12:23  |
| [epiteleō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2005/kjv/tr/0-1/)  | "bring to an end, accomplish, perfect, execute, complete."  | 2 Corinthians 7:1  |
| [artios](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g739/kjv/tr/0-1/)  | "fitted; complete, perfect; having reference apparently to 'special aptitude for given uses'."  | 2 Timothy 3:17  |

Paul said in Philippians 3:12 that he wasn't perfect, so was he unsaved? You know what I think this whole doctrine of sinless perfection boils down to? Pride. Are we humble enough to admit we're imperfect, can't do it on our own, and turn to Jesus through faith, or are we so prideful to think we're without sin and perfect? We are presented as holy, blameless, and faultless through **faith**, not stopping sin (Colossians 1:21-23)! Perfection, or being complete, is not immediate. It's a process. A process which Paul believed wasn't immediate since he said he pressed on towards the goal in the very same passage (Philippians 3:14). Though this may be the case, we shouldn't miss the fact that God wants us to be fully devoted to Him. We need to be all-in for Christ! But as with anything, don't take my--or anyone else's--word for it. Be like a Berean (Acts 17:10-11) and search whether these things are true.

> __Note:__ Colossians 1:21-23 tells us that we are reconciled by His death on the cross for us to be presented as holy, blameless, and faultless before Him if we continue in the faith. Notice what this passage doesn't say. It doesn't say that we *ourselves* are perfect to obtain this by our own efforts, but through our faith, *He* obtained it for us! 

#### 1 John 3
1 John 3:6-10 is what holds the most weight to the sinless perfectionist's claim. The King James Version (KJV), in 1 John 3:6-10, drops the "keeps on..." and "makes a practice of..." for just "sin." For example, the KJV reads as follows:

> <u>1 John 3:6-10 (KJV):</u><br>
> **6** Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<br>
> **7** Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.<br>
> **8** He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<br>
> **9** Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<br>
> **10** In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

Pay very close attention to verse 9, "*...he cannot sin...*" The reason I placed the KJV's translation is because it makes it seem as though a born-again believer literally **cannot** sin. However, 1 John 1:8-2:2 seems to contradict this. So, what's the deal? The Greek suggests to make a practice of sin or live in repetitive/habitual sin--which is why newer translations rightfully add "*...keeps on sinning...*" and "*...makes a practice of sinning...*" Regardless of this, though, there are several schools of thought to interpret 1 John 3:6-10. 

**Perfectionist View**<br>
Proponents of this view were [John Wesley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Wesley) and [Charles Finney](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Grandison-Finney), where much of the [holiness movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/Holiness-movement) originated from. They teach that a Christian cannot perform any sinful behavior and expect to be saved. Charles Finney took this a step further and believed that the second a Christian sinned, they were immediately unsaved. But the problem with this view is what I already brought up: the apostle John makes it clear that we do/can sin in 1 John 1:8-2:2. In addition to this, Galatians 6:1 tells us that we are to restore those who are overtaken in a fault. James 5:16 tells us to confess our sins one to another. How can these be true if we're to be sinless? Peter was found being a hypocrite and not acting in accordance with true Christian conduct (Galatians 2:11-14). Was he unsaved? Thomas doubted and lacked faith in Jesus (John 20:26-28). Was he too unsaved? Part of early church gatherings was confessing their sins before prayer to have a clean conscience before God. This was found in the [Didache](https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/study/module/didache) which means "*The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles*," and was compiled during early church history (before the 3rd century AD). If even the earliest Christian teachings outside of the Bible teach that we need to confess our sins, then where did this teaching and the Bible's teaching get lost on the sinless perfection crowd?

**Eschatological**<br>
This view is almost a future view in which John looked ahead to the perfect end-times state in which he mentioned "*When He appears, we shall be like Him*" in 1 John 3:2. But the problem with this view is that we cannot use it as a test for the here and now. For example, we can know a child of God and a child of the devil by their actions. In the Eschatological view, we cannot know in the present age, but only in the age to come.

**Dual Natures**<br>
This view teaches two natures of the believer: the flesh and the Spirit. There's weight to this claim as it's a common theme seen throughout Scripture. Paul said in Galatians 5:16-17 that we can either walk in the flesh or walk in the Spirit. Romans 8:4 teaches the same thing. We can sow to our flesh or sow to our Spirit (Galatians 6:8). It is sin that dwells in our flesh that causes us to do the things we don't want to do; nothing good dwells in us, namely, the flesh (Romans 7:14-25). Conversely, the Spirit, or God's seed as mentioned in 1 John 3:9 says that God's seed abides in believers; so, everything good dwells in the Spirit. God's seed, or the Spirit itself, cannot sin, but our flesh can. I'm not 100% sold on this claim, I'm just presenting the different interpretations here.  

**Apostasy**<br>
Holders to this view teach that the "sin" mentioned here is apostasy, much like that which is seen in the book of Hebrews (Hebrews 6:4-6 and Hebrews 10:26-29). There are three references to the devil in this passage, so this view focuses on the devil's sin: rebellion. Total rebellion against God through apostasy. Proponents of this view don't hold that sin is all in question here, but a specific kind of sin (apostasy). 

**Persistent Sin**<br>
This view teaches that 1 John 3:6-10 speaks of ongoing, characteristic sin in which a person persists so heavily that they show no repentance and more than likely are not convicted in their sin. This view teaches that a child of God might sin, but they won't persist in sin, which also agrees with 1 John 1:8-2:2. But when they do sin, they repent, confess it before the Lord, and put it to death. This is the view that I tend to lean towards, because I think it has the most support not only from the passage itself, but through other Scriptures as well. We're told in many other passages of certain sins that will not inherit the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:19-21, Ephesians 5:3-5, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, and Revelation 21:8), so we can assume that persisting in these sins align with the context of 1 John 3:6-10 as well.

## Answering Sinless Perfection
### Free of Sin vs. Free from Sin
Many places in Scripture tell us that we're free *from* sin:

* Matthew 1:21
* Acts 13:39
* Romans 6:7
* Romans 6:18
* Romans 6:22
* Romans 8:2
* Revelation 1:5

But there's not a single place in the Bible that tells us that we're free *of* sin. On the contrary, several places teach that there's not a person that can say they don't sin:

* Proverbs 24:16 
* Proverbs 20:9 
* Ecclesiastes 7:20

Why, in James 5:16, does it tell us to confess our sins to each other if sinless perfection is true? Sin is still always there lurking in the shadows and can harden us by its deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:13) if we don't keep watch, unless we too are tempted (Galatians 6:1) and enticed by our own desires (James 1:14) which can lead to sin. The Word tells us that He is faithful and just to forgive us of all sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).

### First John 1:8-2:2
In 1 John 1:8, the apostle John tells us, "*If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves*," but then he starts just a few verses later by saying, "*...I write unto you, that ye sin not...*" John is acknowledging that believers do sin. We are commanded to not sin, abstain from all forms of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22), and to depart from iniquity (2 Timothy 2:19), but we are assured that **if** we do sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ (1 John 2:1) and that He'll forgive us and cleanse of all sin through our confession to Him (1 John 1:9). The apostle John, or any other Christian that doesn't stick to the sinless perfection teachings are **not** encouraging others to sin. This is an exhortation much like that of a seatbelt in a car. In the event of an emergency, the seatbelt is there to save our lives. It's a safety net. This doesn't imply that we're going to be getting in car wrecks at every turn while driving, it's there in case a wreck does happen, but it's not as though we're out searching for wrecks as believers.

### Romans 7:15-24
One of the most famous passages in all the Bible against sinless perfectionism is Romans 7:15-24. And the reason is quite clear once you read the passage. Paul is talking about his struggles in the flesh and reveals the solution to his struggles when he said, "*Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord*." Jesus is how we achieve victory over sin because He is the one who came to save us from it (Matthew 1:21)! But that doesn't mean sin or the temptation to sin is *removed*. We may be done with sin, but sin isn't done with us.

Now, it's very important to address something here. Proponents of sinless perfection teach that Paul was referring to his past self in this passage. But there are several problems with this theory. 

**First** There's just no indication of this at *all*. The context of Romans 6 and the earlier verses of Romans 7 do not indicate there is any recollection going on from Paul to his past. Why wouldn't he say something like his words in 1 Corinthians 13:11 if he was recalling the past? But besides that, just read Romans 7:13-14 to see what I'm referring to. Would this appear to be a normal segway into speaking about your past self? Think of it how you would tell this same story to another person if you're talking about your past self. Would you say, "*We shouldn't continue in sin that grace abounds, we're dead to sin. But I struggle with sin still. I want to do what's right, but I end up doing what's wrong*," or would you say something like, "*...but in my past I struggled with sin*"? Obviously, the latter is a normal conversation flow, but that's not how Paul said it is it? But if in the former case, this person then asked what you meant and you said, "*Oh, I was just referring to my past self*," they would think you're crazy if you just randomly started speaking mid-sentence of your past self in the present-tense. Look back again in that passage. The present-tense is used all throughout, so why would he speak to the present believers and refer to himself in the past at the same time? 

**Second** If Paul is talking about his past life, then why does he give thanks to Jesus? We know Paul was a Pharisee (Acts 23:6) and zealous for God (Acts 22:2-5), which a Pharisee would be, of course. Paul, also said he delighted in the Law of God (Romans 7:22), which is a common saying of the Old Testament (Psalm 1:2, Psalm 119:47, and Psalm 119:16) that a Pharisee would certainly be privy of knowing since they studied it so deeply. So, this argument might seem to fit the position that Paul was recollecting his past as a Pharisee. But here's the problem. In verse 25 Paul says, "*Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!*" Now, why would Paul, in his past as a Pharisee, **ever** give thanks to Jesus, the same Person that Paul was persecuting the followers of? And you can't argue that verse 25 is where he's done recollecting his past because he ends verse 25 in the present-tense by saying, "*So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin*." So, either Paul is flip-flopping from past-tense to present-tense with zero indication or Paul is talking about the present. Just remember Jesus' words to the Pharisees and how they treated Him at every turn. Pharisees hated Jesus and they hated His followers, just like Paul did--and obviously he hated them as he persecuted believers to his own admission (Acts 22:4).

**Third** Paul writes to the Galatian church using almost the exact same phrase as he did in Romans 7:19. So why would Paul, in recollection of his past,  use the same phrase to apply to the Galatian church in the present? In Galatians 5:16-17, Paul tells them that, "*...so that you may not do the things that you please*." 

### John 8:4-11
In the story where the woman was caught in adultery, the Pharisees took her to Jesus to see how He would respond. Since the Law of Moses commanded stoning of such a sin, the Pharisees thought they were pulling a fast one over on the Lord by testing Him. But this is where Jesus says the famous words of, "*Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her*" in verse 7. After some time, Jesus stood up and asked her where the people went. The people left and no one had picked up a stone to cast at the woman. Why? Because they **knew** even they, the supposedly most religious people of that day, had sin. Let that sink in for a moment. Even the Pharisees, as prideful and spiritually blind as they were, knew they were not without sin. 

### The Focus
Read the passage in Philippians 3:4-9 very carefully. Paul is warning those who's worship comes from confidence in the flesh. He warns them by using himself as an example saying that if anyone should have confidence in the flesh, it's him. What exactly did he mean by this "confidence of the flesh"? Paul later describes this as religious acts (Philippians 3:5), zeal and keeping the Law (Philippians 3:6). But Paul later says that none of that matters; it's all counted for loss (Philippians 3:7-8). The only thing that *does* matter is the Lord Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:9). In other words, it's nothing apart from Jesus that we should be trusting in, not our own self-righteous efforts, but through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

The focus of sinless perfection is on us. Or, like the passage we just read says, on our own flesh. What are *we* doing? Or, better yet, what are we *not* doing? The focus never seems to be on Jesus. Sinless perfectionists typically say things like: "*You're not saved if you're still sinning*," "*You need to stop all sin if you want to be saved*," "*You cannot claim to be a Christian and have sin, and if you do have sin, you're unsaved*." But where is Jesus? Every time they mention salvation, it seems to be by turning from sin; Jesus is absent. Why is that? Why is the focus on us stopping sin? Shouldn't the focus *start* with Jesus through our faith in Him and *end* in Jesus with our faith in Him to help us overcome sin? We can't do it on our own by keeping the Law or turning from sin, if we could, Jesus would have died for no reason (Galatians 2:21).

Remember before how I showed that sin is transgression of the Law? If the sinless perfection crowd is so focused on keeping the Law by turning from sin to be saved, then they have fallen from grace (Galatians 5:4). It's no longer about the Head (Colossians 1:18 and Colossians 2:19), but it becomes about the body. We're so focused on what we do, we lose sight of our true focus--Jesus! We must be rooted, built up, and established in our faith in Him (Colossians 2:7 and Ephesians 3:17-18), not our faith in ourselves from turning from sin.

### Faith or Turning from Sin?
So, is salvation by faith or from turning from sin? The answer is a resounding **FAITH**! The Bible makes it so clear, time and time again, that salvation is through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). But the easiest way to debunk the turning from sin for salvation heresy that sinless perfectionists teach is by understanding *when* we get the Holy Spirit. Because Romans 8:9 tells us very plainly that if we don't have the Holy Spirit, we don't belong to God. Now, this should raise the obvious question of, "*How do I get the Holy Spirit*?" Galatians 3:2 tells us exactly how that happens: by faith! Ephesians 1:13-14 tells us the exact same thing: by faith! We hear the Gospel, believe in Jesus, and are sealed right then and there with the Holy Spirit. This is confirmed in the Jerusalem council by Peter defending the faith vs keeping the Law and circumcision for salvation. In Acts 15:7-10, Peter says very clearly that we hear the Gospel and believe. Then God gives us the Holy Spirit and cleanses our hearts by faith. It is by faith. If we're working for salvation by turning from sin and keeping the Law, we are trying to pay for the gift (Romans 4:4-5). And it is a free gift (Romans 5:15-17 and Romans 6:23) to be received (John 1:12, Romans 3:25, Galatians 3:14, and Colossians 2:6), not to be worked for. Where does your faith reside for salvation? In yourself by keeping the Law and turning from sin, or faith in Jesus Christ?  

## Conclusion
Sinless perfection is a teaching that's all too common today. This started to gain much more traction in the early 18th century with John Wesley and later, Charles Finney. They taught that a Christian must be sinless in order to be saved. So, the question then comes, is salvation by turning from sin, or by faith? In this lengthy post, I showed how the sinless perfectionists got their teaching and debunked it with Scripture. First, I showed how sinless perfectionists (maybe inadvertently) teach keeping the Law in order to be saved. This comes from 1 John 3:4 which tells us that "*sin is transgression of the law.*" The natural response to keeping the Law would be blatantly obvious: to not sin--since sin is transgressing the Law--which is precisely what sinless perfectionism teaches. Next, I showed that not even the Bible teaches that we are sinless or can be sinless (Proverbs 24:16, Proverbs 20:9, and Ecclesiastes 7:20). I then showed how to thoroughly debunk sinless perfectionism by one thing: when we receive the Holy Spirit. Since we know that we receive the Holy Spirit by faith the moment we believe (Galatians 3:2 and Ephesians 1:13-14), we cannot say that there is any other way, i.e., turning from sin then becomes an obsolete argument. Jesus is the Way, not us. If we're not receiving Him by faith (John 1:12), we will die in our sins (John 8:24) because we don't believe in Him. As believers, we absolutely should put sin to death, but let's not be so prideful to say that we're sinless it's that being sinless which saves. It's not. It's Jesus and only Jesus.

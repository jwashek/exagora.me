## Intro
Albert Einstein's famous equation of *E = mc<sup>2</sup>* tells us that any body of mass (*m*) multiplied by the speed of light (*c<sup>2</sup>*) determines its kinetic energy (*E*). But light is a very interesting thing. Light has no mass[[<sup>1</sup>]](https://science.howstuffworks.com/light-weigh.htm), therefore, light has no energy. But how can this be true if light produces heat? Think of the sun. Sunlight produces heat, which means it must produce energy by some means. It's true that light has no energy, but it does have momentum. And this is how sunlight can produce heat. But what does all this have to do with the Bible and God? The Bible says that one of the attributes of God is that He's light (1 John 1:5), and actually, light is a *very* familiar topic in the Bible. To understand this a bit more, we can first start by examining what science says about light and compare that with what Scripture says about light. My hope is that we can be encouraged and exhorted in our lives as believers to "let our light so shine" before others!

## Light and Momentum
### What Does Light Do? 
Light does a lot of things. From the physical like lighting a room or feeling the warmth of the sun, to more spiritual or emotional things such as giving comfort. Light is essential for many things. Here are some of the things to keep in the back of our minds, as it'll be even more important in the Scripture section[[<sup>2</sup>]](https://www.thinkersbiblestudies.com/bible-light): 

* Light dispels darkness
* Light can't be seen, but reveals everything in its presence
* Light is essential for growth
* Light fades the further we move from its source

### What Does Science Say?
**About Light**<br>
Remember the equation from Albert Einstein that I alluded to earlier? Well, *E = mc<sup>2</sup>* is part of a more general equation of: *E<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>*. Here's a brief table to describe each component of this equation:

| Letter  | Representation  |
|---|---|
| *E*  | Total energy of the particle  |
| *p*  | Momentum of the particle, related to its motion  |
| *c*  | Speed of light  |
| *m*  | Mass of the particle  |

When a particle is at rest, the above equation reduces to what we are more familiar with, Einstein's *E = mc<sup>2</sup>*. But if a particle has no mass, like that of light, then the equation reduces to *E = pc*. This just simply means that a massless particle gets all its energy from momentum.

Let's detail this a little bit further. In this equation, if that massless particle is also at rest, meaning *p* is at 0, then this object cannot exist. In other words, for light to even exist, it can never be at rest[[<sup>3</sup>]](https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2014/04/01/light-has-no-mass-so-it-also-has-no-energy-according-to-einstein-but-how-can-sunlight-warm-the-earth-without-energy/).

**About Momentum**<br>
Since momentum is a product of light, it's important to build a small foundation here as well. Mainly because this will be much more applicable as it relates to Scripture.

Momentum is the directional property of an object in motion that describes its ability to influence another object upon impact[[<sup>3</sup>]](https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2014/04/01/light-has-no-mass-so-it-also-has-no-energy-according-to-einstein-but-how-can-sunlight-warm-the-earth-without-energy/). The higher the momentum of an object, the greater its influence on another object. For example, kicking a ball from a resting position will still move the ball a great distance, but imagine if you get a running head start and kick the ball as hard as you can. Your momentum is much different than it was while you were sitting still and now the ball is influenced to move at much greater distances due to your momentum. 

### What Does Scripture Say?
#### God's Light
1 John 1:5 tells us that "God is light." This attribute of God is one that makes a little more sense when we apply what we've just learned through what science teaches about light. Remember, for light to exist, it can never be at rest. God, even though it says He rested on the 7th day (Genesis 2:2), never rests from being "light." God never rests from other attributes used to describe Him either, such as "loving" (1 John 4:8 and Exodus 15:13), "holy" (Psalm 99:9), "good" (Mark 10:18), "caring" (1 Peter 5:7), "dependable" (Numbers 23:19), "patient" (2 Peter 3:9), "forgiving" (1 John 1:9 and Psalm 103:3,12), "gracious" (Ephesians 2:8-9 and Psalm 103:8), and "trustworthy" (Psalm 145:13). There are so many more to list on here, but the idea remains: all of God's wonderful attributes are never at rest; they're always at work and on full display.

Remember some of the things that light does in the earlier section?

**Light dispels the darkness** In God, there is *no* darkness. Darkness is often equated to sin or evil in the Bible (John 3:19-20 and Proverbs 2:13). God dispels darkness, as whatever is exposed by the light, it becomes visible (Ephesians 5:13).

**Light can't be seen but reveals everything in its presence** No one has seen God at any time, but Jesus (John 1:18 and 1 John 4:12). Though this is true, God reveals everything in creation so anyone who does not believe in Him is without excuse (Romans 1:19-20). The invisible things of God are made known throughout His creation, regardless of us not physically seeing God. 

**Light is essential for growth** 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 teaches that God provides spiritual growth, though others may have planted the seed and brought water to that seed. It is God we need to seek for spiritual growth. Without Him, we cannot grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18). And just like our spiritual growth, our physical growth will be hindered without God since it is He that causes the grass and plants to grow for us to receive our food from the land (Psalm 104:14). God is essential for both our spiritual and physical growth. 

**Light fades the further we move from its source** The source of light itself does not fade or weaken, but it's us that does. Like the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32), we walk in deeper darkness the farther we stray from the Father. 

#### Our Light
**In Our Conduct**<br>
We must walk as children of light (Ephesians 5:8), because if we walk in darkness and claim to have fellowship with the Lord, we are liars and don't practice the truth (1 John 1:6). If our light is at rest, then our light does not exist. Matthew 5:16 tells us to let our light shine so others may see our good works and give glory to God. In other words, our light is not for us, but for God. It's all to God's glory. And how can we expect others to see God in us if we hide it before them (Matthew 5:15)? Our conduct should be presented as children of God amid a wicked, crooked, and twisted generation (Philippians 2:15).

**In Our Eyes**<br>
The eyes are the light of the body. Where we fix our eyes is extremely important. David said in Psalm 101:3 that he won't set anything worthless before his eyes. Anything that we look upon, be it wicked, worthless, or just a distraction, is enough to draw our attention away from the Lord. We must always look to Jesus (Hebrews 12:2) and focus our eyes upon Him just like the Israelites did to the bronze serpent (Numbers 21:4-9). Jesus recalled this story in John 3:14-15, and there's good reason. All we need to do is look and live! If our eyes are fixed on the Lord, then our eyes will be healthy and our whole body will be full of light (Matthew 6:22-23). So, let's be careful what we put in front of our eyes, and more importantly, where we focus them (Luke 11:35-36).

**In the Gospel**<br>
We are told in 2 Corinthians 4:4 (KJV) that the Gospel has light as well. Satan blinds the minds of the unbelievers *unless* the light of the Gospel shines unto them. We need to always be aware of this fact and ensure the light of the Gospel continues to shine, spread, and bring others to Christ. This world is dark. Very dark. And we must be influential with the light of the Gospel and make every effort to ensure its light is never at rest but has strong momentum. We can influence others *greatly* with sharing the Gospel to them. 

#### Momentum
Remember how momentum describes its ability to influence another object upon impact? As Christians, we *must* be influential. We *must* be impactful. We're told in 1 John 3:18 to not love with our words, but our actions. We need to assume the very same thing with our light. Since we know light cannot exist if it's at rest, may we never allow our light to come to rest. May we never allow the light of the Gospel to be at rest and not to be spread (Mark 16:15) to this world. We need to walk worthy as believers (Ephesians 4:1, Colossians 1:10, and 1 Thessalonians 2:12). And the way in which we do this is by having momentum; having action. Let's be driven by our actions through our obedience to Jesus and the Word (John 14:15, 1 John 2:3-4, and 1 John 3:24), through love (Matthew 22:36-40, 1 John 2:5, 1 John 2:10, 1 John 3:11, 1 John 3:23, 1 John 4:8, and 1 John 4:11), and through letting our light so shine!

## Conclusion
Science and Scripture both have a lot to say about light. Science says that light has no energy but carries momentum. The equation *E<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>* describes this as it relates to light. Since light has no mass, the equation further reduces to *E = pc*. This simply means that if light is ever at rest (*p = 0*), then it cannot exist. Scripture agrees with this by saying that we must let our light so shine before others (Matthew 5:16) and not to hide it before them (Matthew 5:15). As Christians, we are light in this dark and twisted world (Philippians 2:15), so we must always walk in good conduct (Ephesians 4:1, Colossians 1:10, and 1 Thessalonians 2:12) so others may see our good works from our light and give glory to God (Matthew 5:16). Let your light so shine!

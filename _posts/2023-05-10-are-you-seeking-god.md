## Intro
Are you seeking something? Happiness? Peace? Comfort? Hope? Deliverance from something? Whatever it may be, the Bible says quite a bit about who God is and how that can relate to anything we may be seeking. With many verses containing, *God is...* (speaking of His character) or *God of...* (speaking of His essence), we can understand so much of how God can truly help us in any area of our lives--the very areas we may be seeking in. In other words, God Himself is the essence of the good things we seek. Do you feel conflicted or restless? The Bible says that God is a *God of* peace (2 Thessalonians 3:16) and His peace surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7). Do you feel guilty and undeserving of something? The Bible says that *God is* merciful and gracious (Psalm 103:8). Do you feel unloved? The Bible says that *God is* love (1 John 4:8) and His love is steadfast and endures forever (Psalm 136 and Psalm 63:3). Whatever you think you're seeking, you just might be seeking God.

## What We Seek
By doing a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+do+people+seek&oq=what+do+people+seek) of what people seek the most in life, you'll come up with a list of the most common answers. Answers such as:

* 1. Happiness
* 2. Freedom
* 3. Peace

Almost every list that I found mentioned `happiness`, `freedom`, and `peace` within the top 5 things that we seek. This tells me that internally we are unhappy, in bondage, and at conflict. All of these relate to one thing: sin. We are broken. We are lost. We are sinners. But we can be made whole, we can be found, and we can be washed in the blood of Christ. Happiness, freedom, and peace (and anything else we seek) all can be found in the Lord Jesus. And here's how.

### 1. Happiness
If you're seeking happiness, you're seeking a good thing because a joyful heart is good medicine (Proverbs 17:22). Psalm 37:4 tells us to delight in the Lord and He'll give us the desires of our heart. What if your desire itself is to have joy; have happiness? It starts with having your sins forgiven! Something that is only found in the atonement through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross (Colossians 1:14, Acts 10:43, 1 Peter 2:24, and Romans 3:24-25). David said in Psalm 32:1, "*Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.*" The word `blessed` is the Hebrew word "['e≈°er](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h835/kjv/wlc/0-1/)" which translates to `happiness`. Once you're happy in your sins being forgiven, your soul will be happy and rejoice in being saved (Psalm 35:9). From there, joy will come naturally in all areas of your life as it's a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). But, most importantly you will rejoice and find joy in the Lord for taking your sin and nailing it to His cross (Colossians 2:13-14). All to be accepted by faith (1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Ephesians 1:13, Romans 10:9-14, and Acts 15:7-9) in Jesus. And how can this happiness *not* bleed over to other areas of your life? If you are seeking true happiness, it comes by hearing the [gospel](https://www.exagora.me/salvation/what-is-the-gospel/), believing and trusting in Jesus Christ to save you!

### 2. Freedom
What are you looking to be freed from? Drugs? Alcohol? An addiction? Yourself? Whatever the case, you can be assured that your bondage which causes you to be enslaved and captive is directly related to sin. Being imprisoned in sin, addiction, drugs, sexual immorality, or any other godless and earthly thing under the sun can be forgiven, washed, and cast as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). Once you place your faith in Jesus and trust in Him to save you, you will be sealed with the Holy Spirit. As a result, you will have been buried with Him by baptism into death (Romans 6:3-4). Being dead to sin (Romans 6:2), you will then be set *free* from your sin (Romans 6:18, Romans 6:22, Romans 8:2, and Revelation 1:5)! Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins (Matthew 1:21). And through Him, you can have true freedom, freedom from your bondage and captivity of sin. The very things that are causing you to be enslaved are the very things that Jesus came to die for to set you free from. If you are seeking true freedom, it comes by hearing the [gospel](https://www.exagora.me/salvation/what-is-the-gospel/), believing and trusting in Jesus Christ to save you!

### 3. Peace
There are two types of peace. A peace that the world gives (John 14:27) and a peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7). The way in which you can receive this type of peace is through the same means as we already saw in receiving true `happiness` and `freedom`: through Jesus Christ. You can be justified by faith. By trusting in Jesus and Him alone to save you, the Bible says that you can have peace with God (Romans 5:1). In so doing, you can continue this peace by setting your mind on things of the Lord (Romans 8:6) for He will be your peace (Ephesians 2:14). In believing in Him, you can be filled with *all* joy and peace, abounding in hope from the Holy Spirit which would reside in you (Romans 15:13). The Lord of peace Himself is the one that can always give us this peace and in every way (2 Thessalonians 3:16). If you are seeking true peace, it comes by hearing the [gospel](https://www.exagora.me/salvation/what-is-the-gospel/), believing and trusting in Jesus Christ to save you!

## God of...
If happiness, freedom, or peace aren't your thing that you're seeking, maybe consider other attributes that Scripture says that God is the *God of*. I like to think of the phrase *God of* as His essence. *God of love*, *God of peace*; God is love (1 John 4:8), God is peace (Judges 6:24). These attributes are His very essence, His very nature. So, when you're reading the attributes below, keep this in mind. God is the God of so many things that we seek. Happiness, freedom, peace, strength, mercy, comfort, hope. You name it. Whatever we need, God is the supplier of that need because it's who He is.

| Attribute  | Occurrence  | Verse(s)  |
|---|---|---|
| truth  | 4  | Deuteronomy 32:4, Psalm 31:5, and Isaiah 65:16 (2 times)   |
| knowledge  | 1  | 1 Samuel 2:3  |
| salvation  | 14  | 1 Chronicles 16:35, Psalm 18:46, Psalm 24:5, Psalm 25:5, Psalm 51:14, Psalm 65:5, Psalm 68:19, Psalm 68:20, Psalm 79:9, Psalm 85:4, Psalm 88:1, Isaiah 17:10, Micah 7:7, Habakkuk 3:18  |
| righteousness  | 1  | Psalm 4:1  |
| glory  | 4  | Psalm 29:3, Acts 7:2, 1 Corinthians 2:8, James 2:1  |
| life/living  | 4  | Psalm 42:8, Matthew 22:32, Mark 12:27, Luke 20:38  |
| strength  | 1  | Psalm 43:2  |
| mercy  | 2  | Psalm 59:10, Psalm 59:17 |
| patience  | 1  | Romans 15:5  |
| consolation/comfort  | 2  | Romans 15:5, 2 Corinthians 1:3 |
| hope  | 1  | Romans 15:13  |
| peace  | 7  | Romans 15:33, Romans 16:20, 2 Corinthians 13:11, Philippians 4:9, 1 Thessalonians 5:23, 2 Thessalonians 3:16, Hebrews 13:20  |
| love  | 1  | 2 Corinthians 13:11  |
| grace  | 1  | 1 Peter 5:10  |

Are you seeking for truth? Seek God! Are you seeking for knowledge? Seek God! By receiving the Holy Spirit through hearing the gospel and placing your faith in Jesus (are you starting to see a theme?), we receive the fruit of having that Spirit. Fruit such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). Though it's not limited to these fruits, there's much more in store if you seek the Lord. You may think you're seeking these attributes by themselves, but if you're not getting comfort in seeking the supply, maybe you need to seek the Supplier? 

## God is...
Scripture also uses words to say that *God is* something. That "something" is generally part of His character and who He is. This is an important distinction and contrast to the attributes of His essence (*God of...*). We feel that we're lacking something in our lives with the *God of* things we just saw, so we search for them diligently--and let's face it, usually in all the wrong places.

But with character traits (*God is...*), these are things we don't usually seek on our own because we feel that we don't deserve it.  

| Attribute  | Occurrence  | Verse(s)  |
|---|---|---|
| merciful  |  7 | Deuteronomy 4:31, 2 Chronicles 30:9, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 111:4, Psalm 116:5, Psalm 145:8, James 5:11  |
| strength  | 8  | Exodus 15:2, 2 Samuel 22:33, Psalm 28:7, Psalm 28:8, Psalm 46:1, Psalm 73:26, Psalm 118:14, Habakkuk 3:19  |
| salvation  | 5  | Exodus 15:2, Psalm 27:1, Psalm 62:7, Psalm 118:14, Isaiah 12:2  |
| patient  | 5  | Numbers 14:18, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 145:8, Nahum 1:3, 2 Peter 3:9  |
| loving  | 4  | Numbers 14:18, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 145:8, 1 John 4:8, 1 John 4:16  |
| forgiving  | 1  | Numbers 14:18  |
| peace  | 2  | Judges 6:24, 1 Corinthians 14:33  |
| righteous  | 8  | 2 Chronicles 12:6, Psalm 11:7, Psalm 116:5, Psalm 129:4, Psalm 145:17, Jeremiah 23:6, Jeremiah 33:16, Daniel 9:14  |
| light  | 2  | Psalm 27:1, 1 John 1:5  |
| good  | 7  | Psalm 34:8, Psalm 100:5, Psalm 135:3, Jeremiah 33:11, Lamentations 3:25, Nahum 1:7, 1 Peter 2:3  |
| near  |  2 | Psalm 34:18, Psalm 145:18 |
| gracious  | 5  | 2 Chronicles 30:9, Psalm 103:8, Psalm 111:4, Psalm 116:5, Psalm 145:8  |
| great  | 2  |  Job 36:26, Psalm 135:5 |
| faithful  | 4  | Psalm 145:13, 2 Thessalonians 3:3, 1 Corinthians 1:9, 1 Corinthians 10:13  |
| compassionate  | 1  | James 5:11  |
| glory  | 1  | Psalm 62:7  |
| holy  | 1  | Psalm 99:9  |

If we're honest with ourselves, we don't deserve mercy when we're unmerciful; we don't deserve forgiveness when we're unforgiving; we don't deserve compassion when we're not compassionate. But it's at these very moments where that's *exactly* what God wants to provide us with. For it's His kindness that is meant to lead us to repentance (Romans 2:4). His kindness is not meant for us to remain in a sad state of self-despair or sin, but to make a change in our minds towards God, seek Him, and come to faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 20:21).  

## What Are You Seeking?
God is the *God of* all the attributes listed above. He's the *God of* peace, comfort, mercy, hope, and love. Whatever you are seeking, seek His essence for He's all these things for you. *God is* so many things to include merciful, strong, patient, forgiving, gracious, faithful, kind, and compassionate. Whatever you feel you're undeserving of, His character can provide just what you need. 

The whole point of this post was to point to Jesus' words in Matthew 6:33. If we are seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, we'll have all these things added to us. In all that we do, in all that we think, in all that we are... seek God!

## Conclusion
Are you seeking something? Happiness? Peace? Comfort? Hope? Deliverance from something? Whatever you may be seeking, it just may be God because He's the *God of* so many things. And it's these things that we seek most in life. So, the next time you think you might be seeking happiness, or peace, or comfort, or hope, just remember Who is the Supplier of these very things: God.

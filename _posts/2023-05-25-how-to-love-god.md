## Intro
You may have heard of the *[5 Love Languages](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Five_Love_Languages/ZAibPekZIRoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=five+love+languages&printsec=frontcover)*, but if not, it's a book usually recommended to couples looking to get married. It helps you to better understand each other and how your significant other receives love. Be it from *Words of Affirmation*, *Acts of Service*, *Receiving Gifts*, *Quality Time*, or *Physical Touch*, the love languages are the ways in which we like to express love and get love expressed back to us. That being said, can we show God these very love languages? Or maybe there are better love languages that we can show to God? Let's face it, if we are told to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind (Matthew 22:37) then we need to understand the ways in which we express that love to God. So, let's find out how!

## The 5 Love Languages
We love Him because He first loved us (1 John 4:19). But do you ever wonder just how we do this--or how we *can* love God? There are many ways that we can show God that we love Him. Ways that are meaningful where we are *truly* expressing that love to Him in our everyday actions and in everything we do. Some of these ways include the *5 Love Languages*, but before we get into them, let's briefly examine each one:

**Words of Affirmation**: Giving compliments and expressing our affection through words, praise, and appreciation.<br>
**Acts of Service**: Doing kind acts that will positively impact the other party and the relationship as a whole.<br>
**Receiving Gifts**: Presenting gifts, typically unmaterialistic in nature; meaningful gifts that come from the heart.<br>
**Quality Time**: Doing activities together while emphasizing a devotion of our attention to spending time with one another.<br>
**Physical Touch**: Embracing, hugging, holding hands, and making other efforts for physical contact.

### Words of Affirmation
Some general examples of *Words of Affirmation** might include phrases such as: 

* *I appreciate you*
* *Thank you for...*
* *I love you*

The way in which we can tap into *Words of Affirmation* and express that love language to the Lord is by doing the very same thing! Tell Him we're appreciative, tell Him we're thankful, tell Him we love Him. And we see this in action with the Lord's prayer in Matthew 6:9-13. Jesus gives the Father words of affirmation. "*Hallowed be your name*." Through prayer, we should do the same thing. Look for something in your day to be thankful for--there's always something--and thank the Lord for it. If you can't find anything, then tell God how amazing He is for sending Jesus to die on the cross for you. Thank Him that your sins are forgiven and that they're nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14). Thank Him how merciful He is. Thank Him for how gracious He is. Thank Him for the little things and the big things. Thank Him in all circumstances (1 Thessalonians 5:18). Affirm Him through giving praise, blessing His name (Psalm 103), and telling Him you love Him. These are all ways that we can show God our love through *Words of Affirmation.* After all, He *is* worthy and we should make a practice of praising His holy name anyways, right?

### Acts of Service
Showing God love through *Acts of Service* starts with us being humble (1 Peter 5:5). In John 13:1-17, Jesus paints this picture of humility in serving others by washing the disciples' feet. As He was humble in service, we must follow Jesus' example to do the same for others in *all* situations (John 13:15). We've received spiritual gifts from the Lord, and we show we're good stewards of those gifts by being humble in service to one another (1 Peter 4:10 and Romans 12:6-8). By doing this, we will be pleasing to the Lord (Colossians 1:10) and thus, we show our love to Him in a much more meaningful manner.

### Receiving Gifts
No matter what we do, we can't out-give God. This beautiful truth shouldn't stop us in wanting to give to the Lord, though. But before we get into that, let's see some of *His* gift-giving to us (I always love reminding myself of His amazing gifts and promises), which includes:

* Salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9) 
* Spiritual gifts: prophecy, ministry, teaching, exhortation, giving, leading, mercy (Romans 12:6-8)
* The Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13 and Acts 10:45)

Clearly with those, we can't do much in the way of presenting gifts at the same level to God. But that's not the point. The point is our heart. If we love God so much as to want to give Him gifts, this will be like a child drawing a picture for their parent. It's not the picture that we care about as parents--or even what the picture includes--it's the fact that they drew it from their own heart and wanted to present it to us as a gift. And this is similar with us and God. Much of our gift-giving to God comes from our heart in wanting to please Him. A lot of these gifts come in similar ways as we show God love through *Acts of Service*. By serving others with the gifts, we've received from the Lord, this becomes a very gift for us to give back to God. But maybe the biggest way we give gifts to God is through presenting our body, heart, and spirit to Him.

#### Body
Romans 12:1 tells us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice to the Lord. And 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 tells us something similar. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Glorifying Him through our body starts with us allowing Him to use us in whichever way He wills. Ways in which builds His kingdom. Ways in which plants the seed of the Gospel in other's lives. Ways in which we bless and give praise, honor, and glory to His name. And it ends by us not defiling our body through means of sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:13-18). This means we need to keep watch over our body and ensure it's an acceptable and pleasing gift to the Lord.

#### Heart
In Nehemiah 8:9-12, Ezra the priest reads the Law to the Israelites. As he was doing so, the people were weeping bitterly when they heard the words of the Law. Nehemiah and Ezra told the people to not weep but rejoice because the LORD is their strength. The people went away rejoicing greatly and celebrated by eating and drinking. Their hearts were cut to the core by the Word of God, and they wept bitterly over their condition. In turn, their heart was presented as a gift to God by showing their godly sorrow. And look how they were rewarded, by rejoicing greatly and receiving the "fat" of the food and the "sweet" of the drink. We must give our hearts in a similar manner to the Lord. 

#### Spirit 
Psalm 51:16-17 tells us that the sacrifices we can give to God are a broken and contrite Spirit. This may sound odd, but it's a way in which we can give a gift back to the Lord. If we come to Him in pride being proud and boastful, we can be sure that God will not hear us (James 4:6). On the contrary, God's power is made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). And when we approach Him in weakness, in a broken and contrite spirit, this is when we can give God a great gift. It's recognizing that we can't do it alone, that we need help, and that the help in which we seek comes from the Lord. It shows our full reliance and faith towards Him when we do so. Our spirit is usually not something we see as a gift to give to someone, but when that Someone is God, we can be fully assured it's in the right hands.

### Quality Time
If you are dating or married to someone, would your significant other appreciate it if you're always spending time with other people and doing things without them? Probably not. And God isn't happy about that either. Where we spend our time shows a lot about where our heart truly is. Spending *Quality Time* with the Lord starts with us coming to Him in prayer, reading His Word and meditating upon it, having fellowship with other believers, and showing one another love through good deeds and acts of service. If we're not spending time with the Lord, then how do we ever expect to understand Him or even show Him our love?

### Physical Touch
We may not be able to show God love through *Physical Touch* in the traditional sense such as through holding hands, hugging, etc. But what we can do is feel Him in a different way. It starts with us drawing near to God (Psalm 73:28). When we do, He draws near to us (James 4:8). And when we sense His presence and closeness to us, this helps us to become extensions of God and allows us to touch others--through the Gospel, through our light, and through our walk. We love God through *Physical Touch* in a different way. Instead of physically feeling the Lord, we draw near to Him, feel His presence, and then touch others through showing out our faith.  

## God's 5 Love Languages
The *5 Love Languages* are certainly ways in which we can show the Lord our love, and I think we can (and should) use them to do so. But the Word speaks of more useful love languages that we can utilize for God. Though nothing flat-out says, *these are God's 5 love languages* in Scripture, there are very common themes taught throughout the Bible that we can assume are the best ways in which we can love God.    

### Faith
"*Without faith, it's impossible to please Him* (Hebrews 11:6)." Faith is a great love language seen in the Bible that we can use for God. We are saved through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9 and Acts 13:39). We are justified through faith (Romans 5:1-2 and Romans 3:28). Faith is clearly very important. And if faith is the very thing used for us to be pleasing to God, we can assume that's one of God's love languages. Also, other traits tend to accompany faith if we're being diligent with our faith. Traits such as virtue, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love (2 Peter 1:5-7). Faith will show God our love because good deeds will accompany true faith (James 2:18). As you can see, it's not just that "faith" is pleasing, it's so much more than this! 

### Love
Kind of strange to have "love" listed as a love language. But, if we are showing others love, this shows we love God. And on the contrary, if we don't love, the Bible says we don't even know God (1 John 4:8). John 14:15 tells us that if we love Jesus, we'll keep His commandments. But this is easier than we might think. Keeping these commandments is as easy as believing in Jesus and loving one another (1 John 3:23). On a much wider scale, we can fulfill the entire Law through "love" as well (Romans 13:8, Romans 13:10, Romans 5:14, and Matthew 22:36-40). As you can see, "love" might be a little strange itself as a love language for God, but Scripture is clear it's required for us as believers. And if it's required for us to even know God, there's no better love language seen in Scripture than "love" itself.

### Pursuit
The 2nd part of Hebrews 11:6 tells us that God rewards those who diligently seek him. James 4:8 tells us to draw near to God and He will draw near to us. Jeremiah 29:13 tells us to seek God and we'll find Him when we seek Him with all our heart. You get the picture. Pursuing God is a very common theme seen in the Bible. Not only is this one of God's love languages, but we get a beautiful promise from seeking God, too: He has not forsaken those who seek for Him (Psalm 9:10). When we do seek Him, we can rest knowing that He will not forsake us. But even considering the action to seek on our part, we never have to look very far (Acts 17:27). Pursue Him, seek Him... it's a great way to show Him our love.

### Humility
Do a search for "humble" or "humility" in the Bible and you'll find amazing promises such as:

* God rewards humility with riches, honor, and life (Proverbs 22:4)
* God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:5)
* God saves those who are humble and adorns them with salvation (Psalm 18:27 and Psalm 149:4)
* God looks upon those who are humble towards Him (Isaiah 66:2)
* God exalts those who humble themselves (Matthew 23:12 and James 4:10)

If you think about it, salvation in and of itself requires some level of humility. We cannot be saved without realizing we need saved and look to the Savior. Those that are prideful will reject the free gift of God's grace because they feel they don't need it. The humble are not so, as they realize what Jesus did for them on the cross and it is Him in whom they trust.

It's this type of humility that we can use to show God our love. If we were humble enough to recognize we couldn't save ourselves, but trusted in the Lord instead, then we should work to continue that same humility in our everyday walk with Him. Humble yourself in prayer; humble yourself in serving one another; humble yourself in reading His Word and trying to understand Him more. There's so much love that we can offer to the Lord through just being humble before Him.  

### Obedience
I saved probably the most obvious for last: obedience. The Bible speaks of obedience on several occasions. Phrases such as "*If you love me, keep my commandments* (John 14:15)," "*He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me...* (John 14:21)," "*If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him* (John 14:23)," and "*Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments* (1 John 2:3-4)." Along the same lines, the Bible calls us children of God (John 1:12) who believe in Him. And this is important to obedience because, as children, we should honor our earthly father and mother (Exodus 20:12). Just the same, and even more so, we must honor and obey God. He should be our sole focus. Everything we do, everything we think, we must consider it to be pleasing to the Lord. Being an obedient child of God means taking Him at His Word, believing Him, and following what He says. And the Lord will delight in the one that is obedient. What greater way to show God our love than to be obedient to Him?

## Conclusion
Have you ever wondered how we can show the Lord our love? The *5 Love Languages* is a great start for us to do so. Though the *5 Love Languages* was originally meant for couples seeking to better understand their significant other, we can still use *Words of Affirmation*, *Acts of Service*, *Receiving Gifts*, *Quality Time*, and *Physical Touch* in showing our love to God. Even though these aren't explicitly called out in Scripture, we can still find support for the *5 Love Languages*--maybe indirectly--within His Word. But what we can find more directly in the Bible is God's love languages of **Faith**, *Love*, *Pursuit*, *Humility*, and *Obedience*. Whatever the case, and however you choose to show the Lord your love, just do it. Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and mind. Hopefully now you're a little more equipped to do so!

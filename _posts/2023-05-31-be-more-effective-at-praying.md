## Intro
For the Christian, praying is done in many ways. We can pray prayers of thanks or praise to God. We can pray for others and their needs. We can pray requests on behalf of ourselves. Or we can even pray for our enemies (Matthew 5:43-44). In a more objective way, though, prayer can be viewed as worship, adoration, communication, and fellowship with God. Prayer is vital for the believer and should be seen as the best way for us to communicate with our Creator. Some Christians have this nailed down. But for others, praying doesn't come naturally. This post is directed towards the latter. My hope is that you find this to be a blessing and it'll give you a more effective prayer life.

## How To Be Effective
### 1. Get Right with God
Before we can have an effective prayer life, John 9:31 tells us that God doesn't hear sinners. But since He does hear those who does His will and worships Him, this means we need to get right with God before we expect our prayer life to flourish. If you sense sin in your life, confess it before the Lord (1 John 1:9), repent, and take care of it. Get on your knees and seek His forgiveness. If you sense spiritual stagnation (Hebrews 6:12) or lack of growth, be honest with yourself and be aware of your current position before God and move on to maturity (1 Peter 2:2). These are just two common examples, but in any case, make it right by crying out to the Lord for help then rely and trust upon Him to help you. Once you do, you'll notice your prayer life to open up and be more effective.  

### 2. Go To a Secret Place
I can't stress this enough. There's something special about speaking to the Lord in a private place just between you and Him. No distractions.

Charles Stanley was very well known for his own secret place--his [prayer closet](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrQ3pqBOXvB/)--where He spent time with the Lord. His own secret place where just him and the Lord spent quality time together. Your secret place doesn't have to be a closet, yours could be anywhere. Your room, the bathroom, your car... just make it a place where you can sit with the Lord in secret, in silence, and with no distractions.  

### 3. Make It a Habit
Forming a habit, according to a [recent study](https://psychcentral.com/health/need-to-form-a-new-habit#:~:text=Habit%20formation%20can%20take%20an,the%20chances%20of%20habit%20formation), takes just under 2 months for it to become automatic. While this may seem like a long time, I would like to ask, "*How important is your relationship with Jesus?*" You don't have to start with 1-hour long prayers, just take 30 seconds to a minute to pray about something or someone on your heart. If you can't do that every day for 60 days, how much does the Lord mean to you? And how much do other people that are struggling that are in need of prayer mean to you?

I'm a huge believer in doing. If you don't know where to start, just start; if you don't know how to do something, figure it out; if you don't know how to pray, just pray. Don't expect to wait for your prayer life to start itself. You'll always be waiting. If you're one that needs motivated to pray, set an alarm, write a note, do whatever you need to do in order to focus your mind on the Lord to get you in a state of prayer. Take hold of it right now and make it a habit to pray. There's *always* something to pray about and there's *always* something to be thankful to the Lord for.

### 4. Stick to a Schedule
This is a direct build-on to *Make It a Habit*. Once you make prayer a habit, sticking to a schedule will help to solidify that habit. Maybe you need to pray at a very specific time every day? The morning? Before you go to bed? It doesn't matter *when* you pray, it just matters *that* you pray. Sticking to a schedule helps you to keep consistency in your prayer life. We are told to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17), to be constant in prayer (Romans 12:12), and to **always pray** (on all occasions) with all prayer and supplications (Ephesians 6:18). And the way in which this becomes easier is to stick to a clear schedule.

### 5. Be Creative
This is something that I started doing recently (the two examples to follow) and is the inspiration of this post. I heard a sermon which painted an interesting illustration between prayer and communication. Imagine being able to bring any one person back from the dead for you to have a conversation with. At first, you would be thrilled at the idea of speaking to someone--anyone--in history that you admire. Pretty cool, right? Well, at the end of the day you find out that you get to talk to them again tomorrow, but there's a catch. You can only talk about the same topics and follow the exact same flow of conversation as the day prior. You might not care at day 2, but what about at day 5? Day 10? Day 50? 

This is exactly how many of our prayer lives tend to be with God if we're honest. Prayer is not repetitiously repeating the same phrase over and over again. Prayer is a dynamic conversation between you and the Lord--God Almighty!--The Creator of the Universe! Now, this is not to say that you can't pray for the same thing repeatedly. On the contrary, it's just how we approach it. Think of it like cooking. Chicken and veggies may sound boring every day. But think of how many variations of seasoning the chicken and using different veggies that you can come up with. The combinations are endless. And the same with our prayers, we can pray without ceasing without being repetitive. 

#### Create Prayers from Reading
The first way in which we can be creative with our prayer life is by coupling it with our reading of His Word. Win-win, right? The idea is quite simple. Pick a book in the Bible of your choosing (I like to pray beforehand for the Spirit to lead me to what I need to hear), read a chapter, and create a prayer based on that chapter. Imagine you chose the book of 1st John. Here's an example prayer from reading 1st John chapter 3:

```
Dear Heavenly Father, 

May you allow me to abide in You through faith in Your Son, my Savior, Jesus Christ. May I pour my love out to Your children and live my life centered and focused on keeping the commandment to 'believe in the name of Your Son Jesus Christ and love one another.' Father God, may I be always led to do this through the power of Your Holy Spirit. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
```

#### Create Psalms or Poetry
Think of this like your own personal Psalms if you'd like. I think it's a great way for us to pour out our heart to God and still our mind in the presence of the Lord. This can be a unique way in which we worship Him through prayer. Think of something, anything, going on in your life and write it down in the form of a Psalm or poetry--bringing God into your situation. Imagine you are going through an anxious season in your life. Writing down your prayer in a different form like that of a Psalm or poetry will work in two ways: First, you are worshiping the Lord. Second, writing down your feelings (or, journaling/expressive writing) is a phenomenal tool to reduce anxiety. But it doesn't even have to be anxiety, journaling or expressive writing could benefit your overall mental health greatly. What better way to benefit your mental health while also benefiting your spiritual health at the same time? 

### 6. Be Thankful and Praise-filled
Thank God. Plain and simple! One of the more effective ways to increase your prayer life is to be thankful to God. There's so much to be thankful for. The breath in your lungs, the sights, sounds, and smells of nature... there's always something we can thank Him for. Philippians 4:6 tells us in everything to pray, and when we do pray, to do so with thanksgiving. Colossians 4:2 drives this point home in telling us to be *vigilant* in prayer with thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is required for a healthy prayer life. May we take this as an exhortation and always season our prayers with lots of thanksgiving!

### 7. Have Faith!
Possibly the most effective our prayer life can increase is by the thought of receiving an answer to those prayers. And Jesus says just that. He said we will receive the answer by simply believing and having faith (Matthew 21:22). To follow this thought, without faith it's impossible to please Him, and if we come to God in prayer, it only makes sense that we must believe that He will reward us if we diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6). In all your prayers--and in all you do--have faith in Him!
 
## Conclusion
For the Christian, praying is done in many ways. Through praise, requests on behalf of others, or through praying for our enemies. But some Christians' prayer lives are lacking and in need of some aid. The way in which we can receive this aid and be more effective at our prayer life is by first getting right with God. After that, other things can start to fall into place. Things like finding a secret place for our praying, making prayer a habit, sticking to a schedule in our praying, being more creative with our prayers, being always thankful in praying, and by having faith. If we do these things, we'll quickly notice a more effective life of prayer to the Lord.

## Intro
Anxiety is crippling. It can cause so much unneeded and unnecessary damage to us. Through negative thoughts implanted in our minds, these can stir up doubt, fear, and condemnation. All of which destroy our relationship with Jesus. Anxiety is a beast that spirals wildly out of control and is likely impossible for us to tame--alone, that is. Regardless of the power we allow anxiety to hold over us, we have a greater Power from above that allows us to conquer anxiety!

## What Is Anxiety?
I wanted to describe anxiety with possibly the most quoted Psalm in the Bible: Psalm 23. In Psalm 23:5, David says, "*You anoint my head with oil*." You may be asking what in the world that has to do with anxiety, but have you ever wondered what David said that for? 

### The Shepherd and the Sheep
David was a shepherd and shepherds used oil for their sheep to sooth and heal their wounds. But an even more interesting use for oil was as an insect repellant. The shepherd would mix oil with sulfur and pour it on the sheep's head so flies wouldn't bother them. Flies *love* getting into the noses of sheep and laying their eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the larva drive the sheep to bang their heads against rocks or walls--they literally drive the sheep insane.

Just like the flies, intrusive thoughts can implant themselves deep into our minds. They might be annoying at first, but we don't see the real problem until the thoughts spawn other thoughts, and those thoughts multiply into even more thoughts. Before we know it, we get no rest within our own minds, and we are driven insane. Just like the sheep, we need our Shepherd to anoint us with oil. 

## Anxiety In the Greek 
When the Bible says things like, "*do not be anxious for anything...*" like what's seen in Philippians 4:6, the Greek word for `anxious` or `anxiety` is "[merimnaō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3309/kjv/tr/0-1/)". This word holds a lot of the meaning of what we would expect it to. Things like:

```
I. to be anxious
  A. to be troubled with cares
II. to care for, look out for (a thing)
  A. to seek to promote one's interests
  B. caring or providing for
```

But the less obvious and much more fascinating thing we can glean from this Greek word is found in its root word. The root word where "merimnaō" comes from is "[merizō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3307/kjv/tr/0-1/)." And this word helps us to better understand what happens when our minds experience anxiety:

```
I. to divide
  A. to separate into parts, cut into pieces
    i. to divide into parties, i.e., be split into factions
  B. to distribute
    i. a thing among people
    ii. bestow, impart
```

Think about a time when you've been anxious. Doesn't this *perfectly* describe that? With anxiety, our minds are divided and separated into pieces. Pieces that don't agree with each other. And the worse anxiety you experience, the more division and pieces it seems to create. Sometimes it feels as though you drop a glass that shatters before you on the ground. You just stand there gazing at all the tiny pieces not even sure where to begin in cleaning it up. Anxiety makes us feel powerless, divided, and overwhelmed.  

## A House Divided
If your mind is divided, you become at a greater risk of being overcome by the intrusive thoughts of anxiety. Since the mind is divided, it's in a constant battle between itself. The side of rest and the side of unrest; the side of peace and the side of conflict. With any battle, there are losers on both sides. Regardless of if the side of rest or peace wins, we lose a bit of ourselves by allowing anxiety to rob us of our full rest and complete peace that we could have experienced without anxiety. Jesus said in Mark 3:25 that a house divided against itself cannot stand. The same goes with our minds. If our mind is constantly divided, then it, too, cannot stand. The problem with anxiety is that it doesn't only affect us by the "what ifs" of the future, but the "what abouts" of the present, and the "how dids" of the past. It causes us to fear for our futures; it causes us to worry in the present; and it causes us to dwell in the past.

## Where Do We Experience Anxiety?
### With Our Future
Most commonly, our anxiety comes in the form of "what ifs." *What if I lose my job?* *What if my spouse gets sick?* *What if I fail at this or at that?* One of the quickest ways to be driven insane by anxiety are by dozens of statements just like these. As seemingly innocuous as they may be, the more we have, the greater risk we are at being driven insane, becoming overwhelmed, and crippling ourselves in fear--causing us to lose sight of our relationship with the Lord. 

You may be reading this and thinking, "*I've dealt with anxiety for years, it's not like I'm getting rid of it anytime soon*." Consider [a study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-act-be/201907/how-often-do-your-worries-actually-come-true#:~:text=The%20average%20person%20reported%20three,a%20third%20of%20the%20time.) which found 91% of our worries never come true, and for the remaining 9%? These all had better-than-expected outcomes. Think of times in your life when you've worried. How often was this true for you? So, the next time you feel "what ifs" creeping in, try something new: replace them with "even ifs." For example, *what if I lose my job?* turns into *even if I lose my job, I know that God will provide*. Or *what if my spouse gets sick?* turns into *even if my spouse gets sick, I know the Great Physician*! The solution to our problem in our future circumstances is to take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5) and keep your eyes fixed on Jesus! Trust in, submit to, and rely upon Him in all areas of your future. 

### With Our Present
*What about my clothes, what will I wear?* *What about my food, what will I eat?* The Lord Jesus gave some of the most compelling words against these "what abouts" in the Sermon on the Mount. He speaks about not worrying about today since "today" has enough troubles and worries of its own. In that passage (Matthew 6:25-34), Jesus says the phrase, "*do not worry*" 3 separate times. And do you know why He says not to worry? Because our Father in heaven knows our needs and provides for those needs. It's why in Matthew 6:33, Jesus says to seek the kingdom of God first and these things (the needs of the things we tend to worry about) will be added to us. The solution to our problem of anxiety in our present circumstances is to seek God; trust in Him and His provision--He will provide!

### With Our Past
*How did I ever allow that sin in my life?* *How did I make such a terrible decision?* If you don't let your past die, it will never let you live. Maybe that sounds like a cereal box phrase or something you'd find in a fortune cookie, but there's truth in it isn't there? Constantly dwelling in the past causes us to shift our focus from Jesus to ourselves, our past mistakes, or our prior decisions that we just wish we could reverse. *Everybody* has moments of their past they regret--wishing they could jump into a time machine and change the course of their actions. But this is why Paul said in the later part of Philippians 3:13 that he forgets what lies behind and strains forward to what lies ahead. We need to have the same mindset for when we experience anxiety of our past. Our mistakes, our sin, our old selves--they're all in the past. Leave them there. Forget what lies behind, set it aside, and keep running your race; eyes forward upon Jesus (Hebrews 12:1-2). 

## The Power to Overcome
### Be An Overcomer
The power to overcome starts by way of overcoming. I'm stating the obvious on purpose. But how do we overcome? 1 John 5:5 gives us a rather simple answer. Everyone that believes in Jesus, believing that He is the Son of God, is an overcomer. Not only will we be able to overcome anxiety through our faith in the Lord Jesus, but look at what else overcomers receive:

* Hidden manna, a white stone with a name no one knows but us that received it (Revelation 2:17)
* Power over nations (Revelation 2:26)
* White raiment, our names not being blotted out of the Book of Life, and our very name being confessed by Jesus before the Father and His angels (Revelation 3:5)
* To sit with Jesus at His throne (Revelation 3:21)

You want to overcome anxiety? Be an overcomer! If the list above doesn't get you excited for your faith and Who your faith is in, then I don't know what will. That almost in and of itself should overcome any anxiety--our worries seem to melt away when we put promises such as that into perspective.  

### Prayer, Supplication, and Thanksgiving
Reject anxiety! Philippians 4:6 tells us to be anxious for nothing. Have you thought about what that simple phrase really means? It means **nothing**. Give no thought--nothing--to anxiety; reject it. Furthermore, and most importantly, if we do have anxiety, we are told to let our requests be made known to God through prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving. Philippians 4:7 tells us the result of this: the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Do you want deliverance from anxiety and to have a peace that surpasses what your mind can even comprehend? Then take your anxiety to the Lord; lay it at His feet with prayer and thanksgiving. 

The beautiful picture of this word, "guard," is seen in the Greek. The word "[phroureō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5432/kjv/tr/0-1/)" is used which holds the meaning:

```
I. to guard, protect by a military guard, either to prevent hostile invasion, or to keep the inhabitants of a besieged city from flight
II. metaph.
  A. under the control of the Mosaic law, that he might not escape from its power
  B. to protect by guarding, to keep
  C. by watching and guarding to preserve one for the attainment of something
```

Pay close attention to this phrase, "*...prevent hostile invasion...*," as this stuck out to me greatly. This is, after all, what anxiety does. We are invaded by intrusive thoughts from a hostile source. By giving our anxieties to the Lord, casting them upon Him (1 Peter 5:7), and coming to Him in prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving, we are preventing the invasion by coming to His throne boldly (Hebrews 4:16). 

## Conclusion
Overcoming anxiety starts with being an overcomer. And how we do that is through our faith in Jesus, the Son of God. The second part allows us to overcome anxiety through prayer, supplication, and thanksgiving. The Bible says that if we do this, we will be guarded by the peace of God which surpasses all understanding. This is so important because anxiety is crippling. But it doesn't have to be since we have the Shepherd on our side. The Shepherd that anoints our head with oil. Prevent the intrusive thoughts by rejecting anxiety, coming to the Lord in prayer, and trusting that He'll see you through on the other side--because He will.

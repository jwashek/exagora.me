## Intro
Lately, I've been battling very intensely with the idea that I'm beyond the grace of God. I recently finished *Who Am I?: Identity in Christ* by Jerry Bridges. It was a great book and was very helpful to understand our identity in Christ after we trust in Him for salvation. But there was one phrase that really stuck out to me, which was: "Your worst days are never so bad that you are beyond the *reach* of God's grace. And your best days are never so good that you are beyond the *need* for God's grace." This spoke volumes to me because of my war with assurance and thinking I'm unforgiven, unsaved, cast away, and beyond God's grace. So, this had me dig deeper into His grace and what that means to us as believers. I was quickly reminded in my digging of one of my all-time favorite hymns: "*Wonderful Grace of Jesus*", and I wanted to unpack that hymn a little bit in this post. I'm asking that the Lord uses my struggles to hopefully bless someone struggling similarly with feeling hopeless, unforgiven, beyond His grace, or forgotten and cast away. 

## My Struggles
If you've ever read the book, "*Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners*" from John Bunyun, you'll know exactly the fear, agony, torment, condemnation, anguish, terror and guilt someone can go through in their own mind thinking they've committed the unpardonable sin (Matthew 12:31-32) or thinking they've sinned away God's grace. No other book sums up the similar agonizing and destructive thoughts that I've had (and still have from time to time) than "*Grace Abounding*." Thoughts that have caused me to spiral into deep depression, mental anguish, and horrifying despair. If you haven't read the book, that's okay because I can just summarize my thoughts which just so happened to be strikingly similar to John Bunyun. Thoughts like:

* *You may as well give up, you're not forgiven*
* *You've sinned too much for God to forgive you*
* *"God is loving," except to you; "God is merciful," except to you*
* *You're guilty of Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-30, and you're like Esau in Hebrews 12:16-17*
* *You're going to hear the words, "I never knew you..." (Matthew 7:23)*
* *God has rejected you and you're a castaway*
* *God forgave your sins of the past, but not while you claimed to be saved; and even if He did, you've sinned too much*
* *You're fake, you're not a real Christian*
* *All this effort is useless; you're going to end up in hell anyways*

You may be reading this and can't seem to relate, to which I would sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, hope so... But for me, this was and still is at times my reality. Like Bunyun said in "*Grace Abounding*":

> "Oh, no one knows the terrors of those days but myself."

### Why the Thoughts?
In my case, it boils down to two main reasons: (1) sin and (2) attending a sinless perfection church.

#### Sin
I committed many sins presumptuously over the course of several years. Sins I had given up many years ago that came knocking back at the door. These were sins I *knew* were wrong, yet I committed them thinking, "God will forgive me for this." And I gave in to the temptation of them. My first sin I allowed myself to commit was watching porn again. I would watch porn every few weeks or maybe once every few months. This went on and off from maybe 2010 - 2021. I watched it a few times in 2010-2011 but stopped for several years and started again in maybe 2019 or so--though the full details are very blurry, and don't particularly matter. What matters is I did it. But every time I watched it, I would repent and seek God's forgiveness. Every time I hated it, felt terribly convicted and guilty, and would pray to God that He would help me to stop and allow me the victory over it--but most times I gave in to the temptation, so how much did I really hate it and want victory over it? 

My second sin started right around January 2020. I was dealing with severe insomnia and came to my wit's end. I tried so many things but to no avail. I tried the only other thing I could think of and ended up getting my Medical Marijuana card and... I'm sure you can guess the rest. Back then I liked to tell myself I was doing it to help with sleep, but it was bringing back memories of when I used to smoke weed in high school before I got saved. So, I started enjoying it again and would look forward to it; my moments of "relaxing."

This is so embarrassing to admit and I'm deeply ashamed of allowing that garbage into my life again. For both of those sins (not to say those were the only two sins I knew about, but these are the two biggest and the ones causing me the most guilt right now), I thank God that my conscience wasn't seared, and He didn't turn me over to a reprobate mind. The fact that He even allowed me to repent makes me grateful and I'm thankful to Him. And the good Lord knows I spent many hours on my knees crying out to Him--sometimes with tears, sometimes not, but in every case: begging and *pleading* for His forgiveness. 

#### Sinless Perfection Church
And here's where I get to why the guilt came so heavily. At the most inopportune time (right after my wife died and I was already going through intense grief), I stumbled upon a YouTube video which taught sinless perfection. By that, I mean, they taught that you must turn from all sin in order to be saved. And if you claim to be a Christian and have any sin, you're not saved. This means any sin you commit knowingly will automatically kick you out of the kingdom of heaven. The moment you sin, you either proved you weren't a Christian or you lost your salvation. In other words, imagine getting saved and being saved for a handful of years, then you purposefully tell a lie. You knew it was wrong, but you still did it anyways; you've just proved you were unsaved, and you just lost your salvation--or, at least how they teach it. For someone like me, a truth-seeker, this pained me greatly because of the previous section. I knew there were sins I committed presumptuously, having the thought that "God will forgive me." Thoughts I knew were stupid then, but even more stupid now. My condition of my past when I claimed I was a Christian and walking with the Lord was now heavily being scrutinized by me. Partly due to grief and partly due to my wonder of, "*what if what they're teaching is right? I disqualified myself...*" Like an ant under a microscope, I was now examining the smallest details of my past--and the past of my wife who recently died.  

#### The Aftermath
I had quickly spiraled out of control into deep despair thinking I had out-sinned God's grace. Another consuming thought was that my wife was in hell, and it was my fault. I not only allowed sin in my life, but I caused her to stumble many times as well. *Did she repent before she passed?* *What was her faith like when she was sedated in the hospital?* Regardless of any slight comfort I may have felt, the fact remained: I trampled Jesus' sacrifice under foot by sinning presumptuously. I cried out to God on so many occasions for relief and for His forgiveness but felt little to no peace or comfort. There were a handful of times where I truly sensed His presence, His peace and comfort, and a beautiful feeling of fellowship with Him. But these feelings were immediately dashed when I would consider those sins which I had committed when I claimed I was saved. I was fighting a forest fire with a can of Coke. So, back to the whiteboard where "grief," "guilt," "condemnation," "torment," "unsaved," "disqualified," "unforgiven," and "unloved" were written with permanent marker, staring at me as if the words were alive. I could almost hear those words cackling at me maniacally. Stumbling upon warning passages such as Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-30, Hebrews 12:16-17, and Matthew 7:21-23 were truly horrifying to me--to say the absolute least. Christians that say they fear these verses couldn't hold a candle to my utter agony that I was experiencing with them--and that's an understatement. I wasn't sleeping, I didn't want to eat, I was nauseous thinking my eternal destination was set in stone. The very gates of hell had my name written in bold letters on them. In my eyes, I was guilty of all of those warning passages. I had "fallen away", I had "sinned willfully", I was "rejected", and I was going to hear those most dreadful words: "depart from me, I never knew you" from the very One that I claimed to love and follow. I was nauseous, I was frozen in fear, and there was nothing left for me--I couldn't run to Jesus because I had sinned too much for His mercy and grace to embrace me and welcome me with open arms... 

## "Wonderful Grace of Jesus"
...or so I thought. Just in case you haven't heard the hymn, "*Wonderful Grace of Jesus*", here are the lyrics:

```
[Verse 1]
Wonderful grace of Jesus,
greater than all my sin;
how shall my tongue describe it,
where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
setting my spirit free,
for the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

[Refrain]
Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
deeper than the mighty rolling sea,
higher than the mountain, sparkling like a fountain,
all sufficient grace for even me;
broader than the scope of my transgressions, sing it!
greater far than all my sin and shame.
O magnify the precious name of Jesus, praise his name!

[Verse 2]
Wonderful grace of Jesus,
reaching to all the lost,
by it I have been pardoned,
saved to the uttermost.
Chains have been torn asunder,
giving me liberty,
for the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me. 

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Wonderful grace of Jesus,
reaching the most reviled,
by its transforming power
making me God’s dear child,
purchasing peace and heaven
for all eternity,
for the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me

[Refrain]

```

### Greater Than All My Sin
"*But where sin did abound, grace did much more abound* (Romans 5:20)." One of the things that has helped me in understanding God's grace has been going back to the basics and just looking back to the Cross. One of my problems that caused confusion and more despair was looking at the Old Testament in seeing how presumptuous sins were handled. They weren't. The sins atoned for in the Old Testament weren't moral sins like adultery, murder, sexual immorality, or any other willful and deliberate sins (ones in which I knowingly committed), they were sins of ignorance (Leviticus 4 and Numbers 15:30-31). Naturally, this made my heart sink. These sins--these deliberate, willful, defiant, rebellious sins--were actually *not* atoned for. The people were (a) cut off from the community or (b) put to death. *What about my presumptuous sins now, on this side of the Cross?* 

But this is where grace comes in--and it truly is greater than all our sin. Understanding a few things really helped to put things into perspective for me which allowed me to give myself a little grace in the process.

  1. **All my sins were in the future** since Jesus died, was buried, and rose again nearly 2,000 years ago. He knew my future sins when I heard the gospel and cried out to Him for salvation. He knew my sins after I trusted Him for salvation. In addition, David was called a man after God's own heart (Acts 13:22). God knew David's sins much before he ever committed them and still called him a man after His own heart--even after David committed adultery and murder.
  2. **Knowing Jesus** is more important than knowledge of Scriptures, doctrines, or Biblical history. I used to watch NBA a lot while growing up. Imagine the biggest Michael Jordan fan. They know every fact about Michael Jordan, but never actually met him. Another person doesn't know much--if at all--about the NBA or any of Michael Jordan's accolades. But, they personally know him, they are one of Michael's best friends. Who knows him more? Knowing the facts doesn't matter, knowing the person does.  
  3. **The deficiency of the law is where the gospel became superior**. Jesus' once for all sacrifice (Hebrews 10:10) allows the forgiveness of *all* sins and blasphemies (Mark 3:28).
  4. **In a courtroom setting**, God is the Judge, Jesus is the Advocate defending us before the Father, and Satan is the Accuser. The Judge hears the Advocate, but we tend to *only* hear the Accuser.
  5. **Understanding the whole picture of Jesus' sacrifice**. Not only is it important to understand His death, burial, and resurrection, but things were really put into perspective when I pictured Him ascended to the right hand of the Father making intercession for us (Romans 8:34).
  6. **A Bible verse**. After one of the most raw, lamenting prayers of repentance I ever prayed in my life, I received a very interesting answer. I asked God several questions and to just show me if I was forgiven for my presumptuous sins and why I was feeling condemned. Maybe two days later, I saw Romans 8:1 five separate times in five separate ways on a single day. First, it was part of my devotional first thing in the morning. Second, it was the verse of the day for the YouVersion Bible app. Third, it was the basis of a YouTube video that I saved to watch later that day. I told myself the night before that I would watch it after my devotional, having no idea what the video was about other than the title. Fourth, I joined a prayer meeting at work--20 minutes late, which makes this next one even more interesting--and the very second I joined, the *first* message I saw was the Romans 8:1 verse. The odds of that happening were next to impossible since I joined late, and that verse was posted just seconds before I joined the call. Fifth, later in the evening just before bed, I was looking through YouTube Shorts and, yet again, the same verse came to me through a 30 second video. I didn't see that as a coincidence.
  7. **God's forgiveness is greater than ours**. Matthew 18:21-22 speaks of how many times we should forgive someone who wrongs us. Peter asks Jesus, "up to seven?" probably because Judaism taught that you should forgive 3 times for the same offense. So, Peter thought this was more than enough, it was double what Judaism taught, right? But Jesus responded with an answer to essentially forgive a limitless amount. If we are to forgive an unlimited number of times for the same offense, wouldn't God abide by this same standard if He's requesting us to abide by it?
  8. **The warning verses serve as a cattle prod**. The warning verses that instilled so much fear and condemnation into me (Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-30, Hebrews 12:16-17, and Matthew 7:21-23), I realized, were not there to cause such fear and condemnation into believers, but their purpose is to serve as a cattle prod to ensure we're on the right path. They help us in examining ourselves (2 Corinthians 13:5) and ensure genuine believers stick to the narrow path which leads to life (Matthew 7:13-14). The Bible is also filled with promises. The promises of being kept by God's power (1 Peter 1:5) and the many other awesome promises (Philippians 1:6, Romans 8:35-39, John 10:27-30, John 6:37-40, John 5:24, etc.). The warning passages don't render these promises ineffective, nor do they become null and void with the warnings, but they're established within them! A good example of this can be seen later in the book of Acts. In Acts 27:22-26, just before a shipwreck, an angel promises that all on the ship with Paul would be saved--that's the promise. However, in Acts 27:30-31, Paul warns the captain that if anyone leaves the ship, they will not be saved--that's the warning. Just the same, the warning didn't nullify the promise, but the warning was there to keep them fixed **on** the promise.
  9. **The doctrine of justification**. Acts 13:38-39 is an amazing passage that teaches we are justified from all things when we believe in Jesus. But, it gets much better if you look at the Greek. The word `justified` used in that verse is a Present Passive Indicative verb. Simply put, this means the action (justified) is being actively performed on the subject (us who believe in Jesus). But, there's even more. The Passive voice in the Greek means that the subject is *receiving* the action, rather than *performing* the action. If that wasn't enough, there's even more. The Indicative mood in the Greek is a statement of fact--if an action occurs, has occurred, or will occur, it will be rendered in the Indicative mood.

All of these things helped to realize that God's grace truly is greater than all my sin (and your sin). And the good Lord knows if anyone is unworthy for His mercy and grace especially for sinning willfully and deliberately, then that person is me. Regardless of my unworthiness, I'll always be thankful for my many, *many* sins being nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14).   

### All Sufficient Grace
*All sufficient grace for even me*... this was such an impactful statement to me when I re-listened to the "*Wonderful Grace of Jesus*" hymn. God's all sufficient grace is for even ME; for even YOU. No matter what you've done, who you were, who you are--it's nothing that is outside of His grace. And the only way in which we tap into this grace is through faith (Romans 5:2). Are you in need of God's grace? Repent and run to the cross, He will in no wise cast you out (John 6:37). And there is joy in heaven for even one sinner who repents (Luke 15:7,10).

### Taking Away My Burden
Two things stood out to me when I pondered God taking away my burden. First, our sins were cast as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12) and cast into the depths of the sea (Micah 7:19). Both of these are very interesting if you consider when these texts were written. The book of Psalms is thought to have been written in the 5th century B.C., while the book of Micah is thought to have been written in the 8th century B.C. At these times, how easy was it for someone to travel across the world? Near impossible! But what was even more impossible was to reach the deepest depth of the sea or the ocean. Two thousand and some odd years later, we still have a problem with the technology to fully allow us to do this.

Second, Dr. Michael Heiser had a great sermon on the ritual impurities from the Old Testament. This helped me understand something very important. Much like today, and seen in the Old Testament, some things were and still are unavoidable: women's menstrual cycles, loss of blood during childbirth, loss of seminal fluid, touching a dead body, etc. All of these things made people impure in the Old Testament because they go against everything God is. God is eternal and God is life. Losing blood is almost seen as a symptom of death--which is completely against God; God cannot die as He is eternal. Losing seminal fluid is symbolic of losing the life-giving force--again, completely against God; God is life. These impurities all required rituals to become pure again--usually by way of washing, waiting specific periods of time, and by performing certain sacrifices. So, why did that all change with Jesus' sacrifice and how does that help us to understand our burden of sin being taken away?

Our image before God was broken because of our sin. Even with our natural impurities, God saw death and decay in us, which was the need for the restoration of our purity through the ritual cleansing and sacrifices. But Jesus came and restored that image (Romans 8:29, 1 Corinthians 15:49, 2 Corinthians 3:18, and Colossians 3:9-10) through His sacrificial death for you and for me. Since our image is now restored, God doesn't see us the same way when believe in Jesus, the Son of God, for our salvation and hope. When we place our faith in Jesus, God the Father sees His righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30 and 2 Corinthians 5:21). And Jesus becomes our intercessor (Romans 8:34 and Hebrews 7:25) and like a Defense Attorney (1 John 2:1) for us. There's no longer a need for ritual cleansings because Jesus became our final cleansing (1 Corinthians 6:11 and Revelation 1:5); our once for all sacrifice (Hebrews 10:10)! To me, this is even better than considering my sin being cast as far as the east is from the west or thrown to the deepest part of the sea. The burden is gone because our image has been restored, all our sins have been forgiven and nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14), and our sin will not be imputed on us because of our faith in the Lord Jesus (Romans 4:5-8 and Hebrews 10:12-18).

### God's Dear Child
The last part I wanted to talk about in the "*Wonderful Grace of Jesus*" hymn is the phrase *God's dear child*. Allowing us to become children of God through faith in Jesus (Galatians 3:26) is a true showing of His grace if there ever was one. God is our loving Father (Matthew 18:12-14, Psalm 103:13, and 2 Samuel 7:14-15), and as a loving Father, we can use our earthly examples of a loving father to see how His grace might apply to us. Imagine if you're a parent, you know your child will disobey you--it's inevitable. But will you cast them out when they do? They also might disobey your rules on purpose, willfully, rebelliously, defiantly, presumptuously... but will you throw aside your relationship with them and never allow them to say they're sorry and seek your forgiveness? Better scenario: What if they messed up many, many times. Sometimes on purpose, sometimes ignorantly. But they come to you begging for forgiveness. You tell them they're forgiven, but they fall into deep despair. They're condemned and guilty in their own mind. Would you want them to remain in this condition? The same holds true for our Heavenly Father. If His child has truly repented and seeked His forgiveness, then that child is *forgiven*. That's what happens in a family relationship when a child asks their parent for forgiveness. They do not stop being a child, but their relationship does need to be restored. As children that have been adopted (Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:5, and Ephesians 1:5) and called heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29, Titus 3:7, and Ephesians 3:6), let's believe in the promise, cling to Jesus as our hope, and take God at His Word.

## Conclusion
I attempted to show God's grace in the face of us feeling condemned, unworthy, and unforgiven. If anyone has drifted down this path of despair, it was me. So, what better person to talk about it? In allowing sin willfully in my life, I am of one of the most unworthy servants of His grace. But, even in the midst of my weakness, His power is made perfect (2 Corinthians 12:9). If you are struggling with guilt, if you are currently allowing sin in your life, if you see there is no hope for you, there is. It's Jesus! Just remember: your worst days are never so bad that you are beyond the reach of God's grace and your best days are never so good that you are beyond the need for God's grace.

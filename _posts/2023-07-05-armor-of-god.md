## TL;DR
Christians today need to ensure they are donned and always at the ready with the full armor of God. The belt of truth, breastplate of righteousness, shoes of readiness, shield of faith, helmet of salvation, and sword of the spirit--which is the Word of God--all need to be equipped, no pieces lacking. If we lack even one piece of armor, much like any soldier, we will be rendered ineffective and at a greater risk of losing our battle.

## Armor of God
Just like war today, if a soldier isn't fully equipped with all their necessary gear, they run the risk of serious injury or death. How much more so is the importance to be equipped with the whole armor in our spiritual battles? Imagine thinking you're equipped enough to be able to withstand the flaming darts (Ephesians 6:16) hurled by your enemy. I think it's important how it's mentioned that these darts (think arrows, javelins, etc.) are on fire. These darts are consuming. They aren't normal darts which only pierce, they're darts which pierce and consume; burning and spreading with the intent to ignite us, render us completely ineffective, and sear away any areas of our lives we held at high value in our walk with Christ.

I like to think of those "darts" as symbolic to the enemy's attacks in our mind. Maybe they're thoughts that you aren't good enough, maybe it's a thought that you're unworthy to serve God; that you're rejected, cast away, useless, unforgiven and unsaved. Thoughts can be consuming like fire, can they not? Though, maybe these darts aren't thoughts at all, maybe they're temptations in our lives. Temptations where something is hurled our way, and we allow ourselves to stumble into sin. This, too, can be consuming like a fire--and lead to death--but only if we're unequipped. No matter the circumstances and no matter your position to the enemy, whether on the mountain or in the valley, the enemy is just as dangerous no matter your vantage point to them--or rather, *their* vantage point to you. 

### Belt of Truth
Oddly enough, a belt used in the context of this passage was arguably the most important article of a soldier's armor. The belt held all other pieces together and was the first piece worn by the soldier. It stayed close to the body, just as the Truth should for us (John 14:6). Imagine not wearing the belt. How will you distinguish between the truth and a lie? If you're not actively clothing yourself with the truth, your other pieces will be disconnected and unbound. Now imagine a flaming dart coming directly your way without this piece of armor equipped. Without truth protecting you, you're a likely target for consuming thoughts from the darts of the enemy. We must fully wrap ourselves in the truth and allow it to stick as close to us as possible--and at all times.

### Breastplate of Righteousness
A breastplate had two primary purposes. First, it would serve to protect vital organs such as the heart and lungs. Second, it usually came with some form of insignia which identified to whom the soldier belonged. Our conduct and character in our practicing of righteousness (1 John 3:7) allows the world to see the Lord Jesus, our Insignia--the One we represent--by our integrity, virtue, purity of life, righteousness, correctness of thinking, and by our actions. In other words, our behavior identifies Who we serve on the battlefield. And this is why we must actively ensure we're wearing the breastplate of righteousness, protecting our heart to not be struck through the chest by any of the enemy's flaming darts. If we're not careful, our heart--since unprotected--may become corrupt and hardened to the deceitfulness of sin, becoming our downfall and destruction. 

### Shoes of Readiness
A soldier's shoes were very important and allowed them to be ready for any battles they would face. The apostle Paul was thinking along these same lines when he said our shoes are to be put on with the readiness given by the gospel of peace. Shoes give us stability; they're a foundation, and they're what we stand upon--just like we stand upon the gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1). When we go outside, we typically don't even think twice about putting a pair of shoes on. The same should be true with the gospel for our daily lives. We need to stand firm in the gospel, always bringing it into our battles; always having an answer for the hope that is within us (1 Peter 3:15). By the Lord Jesus shedding His blood on the cross, this is how we conquer our enemy which accuses us day and night (Revelation 12:10-11). Let us always call to remembrance the gospel of peace, plead the blood of the Lamb, and never be found not wearing our shoes. A flaming dart can do many things to us if we're not prepared wearing our shoes. We'll be pinned down and eventually we'll be completely immobile. Like an injured sheep moments away from being overcome by a pack of wolves, so we become if we aren't standing upon our firm foundation of the gospel--we're found inured and ineffective: perfect for a lion seeking prey to devour (1 Peter 5:8).

### Shield of Faith
The best piece of defense against the flaming darts is the shield of faith. No other piece of armor is as essential against the weaponry of the enemy than a shield. If you're fighting your battles with an army, imagine putting all your shields together--a near impenetrable fortress can be created with the shields. The same is true with a community of believers in fellowship. The darker your battles and stronger the opposing force's attack against you, the easier the battle becomes when surrounded by other soldiers. Other believer's shields of faith help to encourage, exhort, and repel the enemy attacks for one another. But even on our own, faith is what deflects the very attacks of our enemy. Where this gets interesting is, in the early days when the apostle Paul had written this passage to the church at Ephesus, Romans used to line their shields with leather and soak them in water before battle--just so they could better extinguish flaming arrows. What we can learn from that is, we must always be in the Word, ever increasing our faith (Romans 10:17). We need to soak up every bit of the Word we can, allowing our faith to serve a deeper purpose. Now think of how exposed you would be--regardless of your wearing the other pieces of armor--if you leave off the shield. Not only will our other armor pieces be at risk, but we'll be unproductive and inadequate at shielding our allies when they're under fire from the enemy as well.

### Helmet of Salvation
On the battlefield, if at all possible, a truly successful army is one that knows their enemy. Just as the apostle Paul said to the Corinthian church, we should never be ignorant of Satan's devices (2 Corinthians 2:11 (KJV)). And that word `devices` is actually the inspiration of this post. When going through my own spiritual battles, I would second-guess myself and debate in my mind: *Was that from Satan?* *Does Satan even implant thoughts in our minds?* I realized I wasn't wearing the helmet of salvation because I'd allow these thoughts to spiral and hurl me into despair. Now, the Greek word for `devices`, νόημα ([noēma](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3540/kjv/tr/0-1/)), used in 2nd Corinthians holds the meaning:

```
I. a mental perception, thought
II. an evil purpose
III. that which thinks, the mind, thoughts or purposes
```

So, you see, we can be certain that if a negative thought doesn't align with Scripture or if it's a flat-out lie, that is from Satan and the enemy. Those flaming darts can be presented as thoughts and negatively affect the mind. Helmets cover the head. The helmet of salvation covers the negative thoughts, and the flaming darts are deflected before the real damage can be done. We must keep true to our hope of salvation always wearing our helmet (1 Thessalonians 5:8) and wearing it having full assurance of its protection. 

Now, imagine not wearing the helmet of salvation. How much confidence or assurance will you have? What if you see darts from directions that you wouldn't have seen had you been wearing the helmet? The more enemies or flaming darts we see, the more prone we are to having anxious, cowardly thoughts. The helmet blocks part of our view so we tend to focus head-on towards our enemy--the best way to defeat it.

### Sword of the Spirit
This is the only offensive piece of armor listed in this passage. The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, is the very thing that helps us defeat our enemies. It's also the same thing the Lord Jesus used when He overcame Satan's attacks (Matthew 4:1-10). The even more interesting thing about this weapon is found in the word `Word`. In the Greek, typically λόγος ([logos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3056/kjv/tr/0-1/)) is used for `word`, such as in John 1:1. However, in this passage, ῥῆμα ([rhēma](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4487/kjv/tr/0-1/)) is used. Rhēma holds a cool meaning in "*a series of words joined together into a sentence*." This almost paints the picture of using specific verses for each unique spiritual attack we face. Regardless of this being true or not, we do know our battles all differ drastically. If we aren't equipped with the sword of the Spirit, the only offensive weapon, we will only ever be on the defensive. No matter how strong the other pieces of armor might be, our enemy will never be defeated if we never take the attack to them.

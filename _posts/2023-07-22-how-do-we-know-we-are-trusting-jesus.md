## Intro
Imagine being sick with an illness that only one doctor in the entire world knows how to cure. In speaking with a friend one day, they say to you, "Trust in Dr. Johnson and he'll heal you." You would very likely have follow-up questions: *Who is Dr. Johnson?* *What did he do? *Why do I need to trust in him?* This is sadly how a lot of evangelists approach the gospel these days: *Believe in Jesus and you'll be saved.* Now, I totally agree (and I love Acts 16:31) but to someone who has never heard of Jesus, we need to be better at explaining who He is, what He did, and why people need to trust in Him. It's just like in the doctor analogy. You can say all you want, "*Dr. Johnson will heal you*," but until you tell the person why they need healed, they'll either have a blind faith or a weak trust which will never result in them truly coming to Dr. Johnson for help. Switching back to Christianity, I believe this very reason is a strong indicator why so many Christians are departing the faith or have departed from the faith. I believe they build their house not knowing what trust looks like because they don't have all the bricks to properly lay their foundation.

## What is Trust?
The best approach to starting this post is to define `trust`. The New Testament uses several words for "trust," two of which are ["elpizō"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1679/kjv/tr/0-1/) and ["peithō"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3982/kjv/tr/0-1/). Elpizō holds the meaning of "*hope; to wait for salvation with joy and full confidence; hopefully to trust in*." Peithō, on the other hand, means "*persuade; be persuaded; to trust, have confidence, be confident*" and is actually the root word of [pisteuō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4100/kjv/tr/0-1/) which is used to translate "believe" over 230 times in the New Testament. So, as you can see, when people use words like `trust`, `believe`, and `faith` interchangeably, it's because they hold a lot of the same meaning, and they have the same root word (believe and faith both come from peithō).

### The Aspects of Trust
Now, before we actually trust in something, two or three prerequisites have to occur. 

  1. Knowledge
  2. Conviction
  3. Action

The 3rd aspect of trust (action) isn't always necessary, but the first two have to happen. Before we're persuaded something is true, we *must* be presented with knowledge of it before we come to the conclusion of allowing ourselves to be convinced that it's true. As we move forward, let's keep the analogy presented in the Introduction with Dr. Johnson in mind.

#### Knowledge
You cannot believe something if you're never presented with the information. The same holds true in our scenario with Dr. Johnson. Our friend telling us to "trust in Dr. Johnson to heal you" is meaningless and holds no value to us without knowing who he is, what he does, and why we need to trust in him. Now, imagine our friend presenting the information in a much different way. 

"You have this sickness, there's nothing you can do yourself to be cured. But there's good news--there's a doctor that made a way possible for you to be healed. He is the only person in the entire world that knows how to cure you and he has invented the cure to heal your disease. He has a 100% success rate for all patients that have come to him. Will you trust him?" That's a lot more convincing.

And we answered all our original questions: 

  * **Who is Dr. Johnson?** -- The only doctor in the entire world that can heal our sickness.
  * **What did he do?** -- He made a way possible to heal us by inventing a 100% effective cure.
  * **Why do I need to trust in him?** -- We are sick and in need of healing.

#### Conviction
The only logical next step after you're presented with knowledge is to either (a) accept it or (b) reject it. Knowing who Dr. Johnson is, what he did, and why we need to trust him, it's up to us to align ourselves with this knowledge and allow persuasion to take place with this new information we've been presented with. We are either going to be persuaded enough that he's the only way, or we can cloud our mind with doubt and remain in unbelief, lacking the trust in Dr. Johnson. The more we doubt, the more we deny, and the more we reject, the longer our sickness reigns in us. Assuming we are convinced, we ask our friend, "*What must I do?*" 

#### Action
Trust requires action. Luckily for us, our friend has Dr. Johnson's contact information, and they quickly hand it over to us. We are convinced enough that Dr. Johnson is the only way, that he can heal us, and that we're in need of being healed, but will we take the step of faith and call him? Seems too easy, right? Just merely being presented with the knowledge cannot make us whole and restored, we must act.

## Trusting In Jesus
Bringing this full circle back to the post's title: *How Do We Know We're Trusting in Jesus?* Let's start out by concluding the analogy of Dr. Johnson. There are two options we could have taken, to either call him or not. If we called him, did we trust him? Absolutely! This means the inverse is true: if we never reached out to Dr. Johnson, we could reasonably conclude that we didn't trust in him enough to heal us; we never acted because we doubted he could heal us, even with the evidence that was presented to us. 

The same is true with Jesus. "*Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved*." Okay, but *who is Jesus?* *What did He do? *Why do I need to trust in Him?*

### The "Knowledge"
We're all sinners (Romans 3:23 and 1 John 1:8,10). This sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2) and unfortunately we cannot earn our own way back into a right relationship with God through our own good works (Romans 4:4, Psalm 14:3, and Romans 3:11-18). The consequence of our sin is death (Romans 6:23) and if we die in our sins without having them forgiven, we can expect an eternity separated from God in hell (Revelation 20:14-15 and Revelation 21:8).

But Jesus, the Son of God (1 John 5:5) came down from heaven to die on the cross to save us from our sins (Matthew 1:21). He died, was buried, and rose again 3 days later (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) so that we could have redemption and the forgiveness of sins (Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, and Acts 13:38-39). We receive this forgiveness only by God's grace through our trust in Jesus (John 1:12, John 3:16, Acts 16:31, and Ephesians 2:8-9). 

### The "Conviction"
These questions are also now answered for us:

  * **Who is Jesus?** -- Jesus is the Son of God and is the only way that we can have our sins forgiven (John 14:6).
  * **What did He do?** -- Jesus came from heaven as God in the flesh, to shed His blood by dying on the cross and being resurrected 3 days later so that our sins would be forgiven by God's grace through our faith in Jesus.
  * **Why do I need to trust in Him?** -- We are all sinners separated from God through our sin. The only restoration and redemption from our sins can be found through His death, burial, and resurrection. Believing the gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1-4, i.e., Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection) and trusting in Jesus is the only way our sins can be forgiven and our relationship to God can be reconciled (2 Corinthians 5:18).

After coming to the knowledge of truth (1 Timothy 2:4), we have a decision to make. This is where we need to make a choice to repent (Luke 13:5 and Mark 1:15)--or change our mind--and believe the gospel, the good news of Jesus coming as God in the flesh to die for our sins, or we can reject it. If we've been convinced enough of our sinful state and if we've become guilty before God (Romans 3:19), then this is where we put our faith into action.

### The "Action"
> <u>Ephesians 1:13</u>: In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit

No other verse in the New Testament, at least in my mind, does a better job at explaining the process of salvation. I've written about this verse a couple times before, but play close attention to the order of things:

  1. We hear the gospel
  2. We believe in Jesus
  3. We're sealed with the Holy Spirit

A great complementary set of verses can be seen in Romans 10:9-14:

> <u>Romans 10:9-14</u>:<br> 
> **9** because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br>
> **10** For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.<br>
> **11** For the Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame." <br>
> **12** For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.<br>
> **13** For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."<br>
> **14** How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?

Notice the steps listed in verse 14: they align with what we just saw in Ephesians. If we walk the verse back, we see that we hear the gospel, we believe in Jesus, and we're saved! Compare this with Acts 10:34-44. After Peter preaches the gospel to Cornelius, verse 44 says the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. There's no mention of prayer--only belief, faith, trust; that's the action. They were presented with the gospel, they were persuaded, and they chose to believe. 

## How Do We Know?
The majority of this post was foundational, basic "Christianity 101" type of knowledge. However, sometimes it helps to go back to the basics if we're unsure of what trust looks like and how we know we're actually trusting in Him. 

Since we have the gospel as our foundation, how do we actually *know* we're trusting Christ?

### 1. By Taking God At His Word
The first step of knowing that we're trusting in Jesus, which is why I took so much time presenting the gospel, is what was just said. Taking God at His word starts with understanding the words of the gospel. Do you believe you're a sinner? Do you believe there's nothing you can do to earn your way to heaven? Do you know Jesus came as God in the flesh and died for your sins and was resurrected three days later? Answering "Yes" to those questions shows your trust is right where it needs to be regardless of your feelings. The facts trump feelings every time. Period. Don't look past the period.

### 2. Removing Your Feelings
Sometimes it won't always feel like we're trusting in Jesus because our feelings are fleeting and fickle. We're human after all. Regardless of our feelings, though, God is stronger than our heart and knows everything (1 John 3:20). Doubts that we're actually trusting Jesus will never allow us to feel trust or be assured in our feelings, and this is why it's one of Satan's best-used tactics. The enemy accuses us before God and does such a good job at it that we tend to believe the lies. This is why we need to move on to the facts and off from our feelings. Just as our thoughts can move in a hundred different directions, so can our feelings. However, trust isn't something that does this. Trust is anchored, deeply rooted in the form of conviction and is *not* a feeling. It's for this reason that, instead of examining feelings for trust, we should examine action--how are we living? 

### 3. How To Know We Know Him
In 1 John 2:3, it tells us exactly how we know we've come to know Jesus: if we keep His commandments. And what commandments are we supposed to keep? 1 John 3:23-24 recaps this as (1) believing in Jesus and (2) loving one another. This is such a common theme in the New Testament and sums up the entirety of our Christian walk through just one simple word: love (Matthew 22:36-40, Romans 13:8-10, Galatians 5:14, and James 2:8)! In other words, action--faith working through love (Galatians 5:6) since it is love that holds things together in perfect harmony (Colossians 3:14). Coincidentally, Jesus said that "love" is how others will know we're disciples of His (John 13:35). So, what do our actions tell us about Who or what we're trusting in? The answer is right in the question--our actions tell us *exactly* what we're trusting in! Think of it in terms of a relationship. If you claim to love someone, do you do it only in words, or do you best show your love through action (1 John 3:18-19)? If you're wondering where your trust lies, look at how you conduct yourself through your actions. Are you making efforts to love God and love others? Serve God and serve others? If you love Jesus, keep His commandments and do what He says (John 14:15, John 14:23, and Luke 6:46)--if you're doing these things, praying, reading your Bible, etc. these all prove Who you're trusting in. These aren't a means of salvation, but a result of salvation. We're not saved by works, but we're saved *for* good works (Ephesians 2:10 and Titus 3:5-8). If you want to perform the works of God, start by trusting in Jesus (John 6:28-29). If this seems like a circular argument, much like how John lists the commandments as believing in Jesus and loving one another, it's because it is. It shows us the importance of trusting in Jesus and the importance of showing our love for others. Abiding in Him through faith is how we produce fruit to begin with (John 15:4-5). And that term, "abide" is not a past event, it's present tense.

### 4. Present Posture Over Past Action
A lot of times, we spend *entirely* too much time worrying if we "accepted" or "believed" or "trusted" Christ the right way. *Did I believe hard enough?* *Was there enough of a change?* *Did I mature enough?* It becomes a means of trusting actions more than the Person. Our own self becomes the object of our trust rather than Jesus. Sure, we're to examine ourselves (2 Corinthians 13:5), but we're to examine whether we're *in the faith* and not if we're doing enough works or doing so perfectly. Examining ourselves the wrong way pushes us towards perfectionism and back to the past--and keeps us there. But this shouldn't matter and shouldn't be our concern. Think of it another way. If you sat in your chair and I asked you when you first sat down, chances are high you wouldn't know the exact time down to the second. But one thing's for certain, you're sitting in the chair *right now*. And that's what matters. And that's what you know. Your past actions don't always determine your present posture. Presently, it's more important to know you're sitting down rather than knowing *when* you sat down. Abiding in Jesus is a continuous, present tense action. It's not a one-time event--it's believing loyalty. You will produce fruit while you abide in the Vine. And presently abiding in the Vine allows you to know Who you're trusting in. 

## Conclusion
Trusting in Jesus is our foundation as believers. We're saved by God's grace through our faith in Jesus, so it's important to understand how we know we're trusting in Him and equally important that "we know that we know". Luckily, the Bible gives us good indicators of these things. Having a solid foundation of the gospel, though, is really where trust starts. Knowledge, conviction, and action are soon to follow. We cannot be persuaded if we never are presented with the knowledge, and we won't move with action if we haven't been convinced. The action of knowing we're trusting in Jesus starts by taking God at His word. God is trustworthy and keeps His word. We don't need to fear that God will break that promise--that goes completely against His character, and we don't even have the slightest example of this seen in Scripture. Next, we need to remove our feelings. Feelings are fickle and feelings get in the way. We cannot trust our feelings, but we can trust in God. Finally, we're told in 1 John that we know that we know Jesus by keeping His commandments. Jesus also said if we love Him, we'll do the same. Performing these very actions proves that we're in Jesus and abiding in the Vine. We shouldn't be concerned with our past action of initial trust, belief, or faith, but we must examine ourselves in our *present* position in where our trust stands in the Lord.

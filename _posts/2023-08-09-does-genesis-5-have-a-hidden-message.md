## Intro
Sometimes it's hard to read a genealogy in the Bible and get something useful out of it other than knowing who *begat who*. However, Genesis 5 just might be the exception to that. And a pretty remarkable exception because not only is there a prophetic hidden message contained within Genesis 5, but it's also the earliest mention of the gospel found in the Bible... but you have to look a little deeper than just the surface.

### Genesis 5
Now, if you read Genesis 5:1-29, you'll admittedly read nothing out of the ordinary. *This person begat this person*; *that person begat that person...* But the interesting thing comes in the names. From Adam to Noah, the message is hidden within the names! 

#### Looking Deeper

| Name  | Name's Meaning  |
|---|---|
| Adam   | Man  |
| Seth  | Appointed  |
| Enosh  | Mortal  |
| Kenan  | Sorrow  |
| Mahalalel  | The Blessed God  |
| Jared  | Shall come down  |
| Enoch  | Teaching  |
| Methusaleh  | His death shall bring  |
| Lamech  | The despairing  |
| Noah  | Comfort/Rest  |

The above table shows the names from Adam to Noah, and their respective name's meaning. Putting the meanings of the names together you get: <b>*Man appointed mortal sorrow, the Blessed God shall come down teaching [that] His death shall bring the despairing comfort*</b>. I'm not sure if you believe in coincidences, but isn't it odd that the very gospel message is found in a prophetic manner through a genealogy (of all things) in the 1st book of the Bible? I, for one, won't be so dismissive of genealogies anymore.

### ...Even Deeper
Let's just take the first and the last name from the list above through the lens of what Jesus did for us on the cross. Adam and Noah; or the start of the hidden message to the end of the hidden message. Adam: "man," and Noah: "comfort/rest". 

#### The 1st and 2nd Adam
Adam is the 1st Adam (obviously), and Jesus is often called the 2nd Adam (1 Corinthians 15:45-47). Through Adam's disobedience, all were made sinners. But through Jesus' obedience, many are made righteous (Romans 5:19). What Adam couldn't accomplish and where he failed, Jesus fulfilled (Matthew 5:17) and restored. Adam, meaning "man" or "mankind" in Hebrew, holds more significance than just on the surface because Adam, as man, brought sin into the world and through our own sin, our image was clouded. But through the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, we have been reconciled back to God (Colossians 1:21-22) and our image has been restored (Romans 8:29, 1 Corinthians 15:49, and 2 Corinthians 3:18). Irenaeus of Lyons (born 120-140 AD, died 200-203 AD) had an interesting theory of this where he mentioned in *Against Heresies* that Jesus' human and divine natures were essential in the process and work of redemption because His divine and human natures--together--allows humanity to participate in God's life; to reconcile and redeem humanity and allow fellowship with God again. In other words, the [Recapitulation Theory](https://www.gotquestions.org/recapitulation-theory-atonement.html) of atonement. 

#### The Ark and Jesus 
Jesus likens His 2nd coming to the "Days of Noah" in Matthew 24:37. Though, Jesus was referring to His 2nd coming in that passage, I think we can draw some comparisons to His 1st coming also. In the days of Noah, as the ark was being built, God commanded that pitch be put outside and inside the ark (Genesis 6:14). This might be one of those things that we gloss over as Christians. Scholars have debated the reason for placing pitch upon the ark for centuries. Some of the reasons conclude:

* For waterproofing
* As a sort of armor; protection

Though any of these reasons (or others) could be true, I like the symbolic answer a little more. This answer just so happens to be another hidden message found in Scripture. Why? "Pitch" is used 2 times in Genesis 6:14. The first time, the Hebrew word ["kāp̄ar"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3722/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is used, which means: 

```
I. to cover, purge, make an atonement, make reconciliation, cover over with pitch.
```

This is very interesting considering Jesus' death on the cross made atonement for us (Romans 5:11 (KJV)); He became our propitiation, or appeasement (Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, and 1 John 4:10) that reconciled us back to God. Our sins have been purged through His sacrifice (Hebrews 1:3 (KJV) and 2 Peter 1:9 (KJV)). What's even more interesting, though, is the 2nd usage of "pitch" in Genesis 6:14. The Hebrew word ["kōp̄er"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h3724/kjv/wlc/0-1/) is used, which holds the meaning:

```
I. price of a life, ransom, bribe.
```

Notice the word "ransom," as this is precisely what Jesus did by giving His life as a ransom for all who trust in Him (Matthew 20:28 (KJV) and 1 Timothy 2:6 (KJV)).

Back to the more surface level application, Jesus calls Himself the Door of the sheep (John 10:7,9). Just as though the people of those days had every ability to enter through the door of the ark, we must enter in through the Door which is Jesus. On the outside, the pitch which covers our Ark will purge our sins and make an atonement for us. And on the inside, the pitch is the ransom in which we received--His life for ours--the most beautiful, undeserved, unmerited exchange. And all we need to do is enter in through the Door. Thanks be to God for His unspeakable gift (2 Corinthians 9:15 (KJV))!


## Conclusion
Genesis chapter 5 tells us a prophetic message of the coming Savior through a genealogy. By reading into the names from Adam to Noah and their name's meanings, we receive a message of: *Man [is] appointed mortal sorrow, [but] the Blessed God shall come down teaching [that] His death shall bring the despairing comfort*. Coincidental or not, we get the very message of the gospel within possibly the most inconspicuous methods. If we dig a little further, we notice that Jesus is symbolic even within the names themselves. By taking Adam as an example, we see Jesus as the 2nd Adam, restoring and perfecting what Adam failed to do. Another example is seen in Noah. Noah placed pitch outside and inside the ark. All were given the opportunity to enter through the door of the ark. When it comes to Jesus, He is our Door. Entering in through Him will ensure our safety and deliverance.

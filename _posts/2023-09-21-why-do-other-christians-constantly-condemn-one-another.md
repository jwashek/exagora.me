## Intro
My least favorite thing I see within the Church today is the constant dejecting and writing off of other believers. Sadly, preachers and teachers are often the biggest culprits. But this doesn't excuse the average believer, as they're just as guilty. "*Wow, that person isn't acting like a Christian, they're clearly unsaved...*" Have you ever heard a similar phrase? I completely detest, despise, and disagree with statements such as those. First, we don't know their hearts. Second, are we so perfect and above reproach ourselves to cast stones at others? Therefore, we need to be better at building up and restoring believers, rather than tearing down and casting them away.

## The Wrong Approach
Many preachers and teachers today take the wrong approach when they see Christians partaking in sin or behaving contrary to how Christians should be behaving. Instead of restoring a brother in a fault (Galatians 6:1) or converting someone who wanders from the truth (James 5:19-20), these Christians immediately jump to the conclusion that the person is unsaved, a false convert, lost, a heretic, etc. They push them aside making no attempts in restoring the person back to God. 

Take for example Paul Washer. This is not to call him out specifically, but his quote below shows the heart of the issue I'm trying to get at. 
 
> "*If a person professes faith in Christ and yet falls away or makes no progress in godliness, it does not mean that he has lost his salvation. It reveals that he was never truly converted.*"

### Lack of Grace
The problem with this quote and quotes just like it assumes a standard of perfection--no sin and perfect growth after one places their faith in Christ. But what's considered growth that's acceptable to him? And what's the rate of growth we're supposed to progress at? Look at 2 Peter 3:18 and notice what it says: *But grow in grace...* Paul Washer said if they're not progressing in godliness (i.e., growing) then they're not truly converted. Let me ask you if his quote is gracious communication seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6)? Do you see the irony there? These Christians are quickly becoming like the Pharisee in Luke 18:10-14, becoming haughty in their own behavior and looking down on the conduct of others while exalting themselves on pedestals far above their similarly imperfect counterparts. They're not growing in grace because they're lacking in grace themselves. They expect others to be growing in other ways, but they aren't holding themselves to the same standard when it comes to *showing* grace, compassion, and love. Like the Pharisees of those days, they're hypocritical and need to see the plank in their own eye (Matthew 7:3-5).

Hebrews 5:12-14,6:1-3 speaks of spiritual maturity a little further. The believers are being admonished for being babes, just like in 1 Corinthians 3:1. What's interesting is the writer of Hebrews says, "*...this we will do if God permits*," speaking of moving to maturity. So, are these people all unsaved if God doesn't permit them to move to maturity? What about the carnal Corinthians, were they false converts? According to Paul Washer and other Christians that think this way, yes. The problem really boils down to one thing: Christians that write off other believers cannot look into a person's heart and see their future. Because only *God* can. They (and we) can only see the fruit, but God sees the root. 

### A Present Perspective
#### Returning to God
Present posture does not indicate future position. But Christians that write other believers off as being unsaved seem to believe the opposite. It's because like all humans, we're just that: human. We're limited, God is unlimited. We're finite, God is infinite. We inadvertently box God into our own understanding of what we know and see--into our own perception--but this is the wrong approach. God is so far above our ways and our thoughts (Isaiah 55:8). God knows the future and only God searches the heart and can know the intent of our thoughts (Jeremiah 17:10 and 1 Chronicles 28:9). This being the case, we **only** see the present and we *don't* know the person's heart, so who are we to say another believer is unsaved because of their present actions or conduct? If those Christians that are struggling are actively confessing and repenting before the Lord, begging Him for help in their sin or lack of maturity/growth, who are we to write them off as unsaved? We don't know what happens between them and God behind closed doors. 

Imagine being alive in David's day and you witnessed his sin of adultery with Bathsheba and saw his scheming to murder Uriah (2 Samuel 11). This David, "a man after God's own heart" (Acts 13:22), committed some of the most wicked and vile sins a human can commit. If anyone saw David's conduct, they would probably be right to assume, "*this guy is clearly unsaved...*," but present posture does not indicate future position. David repented deeply (Psalm 51) and was restored back in a right relationship to God. 

And let's not forget Manasseh (2 Kings 21:1-20 and 2 Chronicles 33:1-20), who's an even better example. Let's examine some of his sins:

* Idolatry
* Mass murder (2 Kings 21:16)
* Sacrificed his own children to other gods (2 Chronicles 33:6)
* Built altars for false gods in the very house of God (2 Chronicles 33:4-5)
* Committed sorcery and necromancy (2 Chronicles 33:6)
* Led Judah and Jerusalem to commit idolatry (2 Chronicles 33:9)

Manasseh is the prime example of "going off the deep end" and being too stubborn to listen (2 Chronicles 33:10). The text says that God tried getting his attention, but Manasseh paid no care to Him and didn't change his mind or his ways. However, after some time (which isn't given in Scripture), Manasseh repented (2 Chronicles 33:11-16,19-20). What we can learn from Manasseh is that no one is too far gone. As long our fellow believer has breath in their lungs, there's time for them to repent and get right with God. It's not our duty to repent for them, but we must help restore them to a spirit of meekness (Galatians 6:1). Wouldn't you want the same for you? 

### Being a Bad Imitator
We are called to be imitators of God as a child imitates their parent (Ephesians 5:1-2). To walk in this way is to love as He loves and by imitating His other characteristics, which some include:

* Grace and mercy (Psalm 103:8, Psalm 111:4, Psalm 116:5, Psalm 145:8)
* Compassion (James 5:11)
* Forgiveness (Luke 17:4)
* Patience (Exodus 34:6 and Psalm 103:8)

Now imagine a Christian you've known for years, but you notice little to no growth and notice them living in unrepentant sin. Do you attempt to nudge them in the right direction through exhortation, encouragement, admonishment, and discipline? Or do you say to them, "You haven't grown and you're still in sin, you're a false convert"? Of course, you would never tell someone that without even first attempting to warn them, pray for them, and help restore them to the right path. If these Christians truly cared for the soul of others and if they had an urgency with eternity in mind, they certainly wouldn't be so quick to write off other believers. Think about it. If they truly cared about Christians going to hell, they wouldn't approach it the way they do with a complete disregard of grace, no mercy, zero forgiveness, and an absence of love. They so readily accepted God's grace themselves by repenting and placing their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and trusting in Him for their salvation, but they turn their cheek in offering grace to others? These Christians that propagate this damaging garbage are only bringing other's faith to ruin (2 Timothy 2:14). I wonder how many genuine born-again believers have fallen away from the faith because they felt hopeless, rejected, unloved, and worthless being called a false convert?

## The Right Approach
### Pray, Push, and Persist
#### Pray
We are told to pray for those in sin (1 John 5:16 and James 5:15-16). But even more than that, if we are "*making supplications for all saints* (Ephesians 6:18)," then I think we need to also ask how God can help us by bringing action from our prayers. In other words, I don't believe all situations require us to *just* pray. If we truly care about our brothers and sisters that are gripped by sin, prayer is paramount. But if we are honestly concerned about our brothers' and sisters' standing before God, then prayer might not be the *only* answer. 

#### Push
If we see a brother sin, Jesus tells us to rebuke them. If they repent, Jesus says to forgive them. If they commit a sin against us 7 times the same day and they repent every time, Jesus says we *must* forgive them (Luke 17:3-4). We need to use this same method in continuously pushing our brothers and sisters to repentance, restoration, and reconciliation. No matter the depth and gravity of their sin--if it's not God's will that any should perish, but that all reach repentance (2 Peter 3:9), if they themselves aren't repenting, we need to sharply correct them and bring them back to the love of God. We have a ministry of reconciliation through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:18), why not use it to our advantage in accomplishing God's will for our fellow believers? Instead of tearing down and condemning them, we can gracefully expose their unfruitful works of darkness (Ephesians 5:11) and push them towards repentance, restoration, and reconciliation.

#### Persist
If we catch our fellow believer in sin and notice they aren't repenting, we should exercise our fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)--namely patience (but realistically, all of the fruit). We must endure with patience in their struggles with them, never condemning, accusing, or writing them off as unsaved. If we are to truly bear their burdens (Galatians 6:2), how can we do that if we're immediately judging their eternal standing before God? We don't know their heart. But what we do know is their sin will find them out (Numbers 32:23). Before it does, we must persist in pushing them to repent and be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:20). We know only the present, not the future, but we can't define someone and slap a label on them solely based on the present and what we see in their current circumstances. 

### Future Perspective
Just after the parable of the sower and the seed, Jesus said, "lest at any time they should hear, understand, and be converted (Matthew 13:15 and Mark 4:12)." Even when mentioning people falling into different categories of how they respond to the gospel (both bad and good), Jesus didn't write them off as being in this category for good. He said, "...*at any time*..." they could be converted. All they need to do is hear and understand. The problem is, Christians today still hold to a Pharisaical method of *holier than thou* when considering their brothers and sisters. *I'm so thankful I'm not like Joe Schmoe and sin like he does...* If our minds were set with eternity in mind, and our hearts truly cared for our fellow believers (our very brothers and sisters in Christ), then how would we not want to influence them to move to maturity, practice holiness, and depart from iniquity? 

## Conclusion
We need to be better to our fellow Christians. So many Christians do a horrible job at practicing love between their fellow brothers and sisters in the Lord. If they see a brother in a fault, instead of restoring them to a spirit meekness, they shut them down by claiming they're unsaved, false converts, heretics, etc.; thereby glorifying themselves and stepping on others. Instead of writing off carnal believers in Corinth, Paul instead admonished and disciplined them. When did we change from extending our hand to help our fellow believer who's ensnared by sin or overtaken in a fault? We need to be better by pushing other believers to repentance and leading them back to God's mercy and grace.

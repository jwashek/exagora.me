## Intro
Divine determinism essentially teaches that God determines, ordains, or decrees all things that come to pass. Things that have happened, are happening, and will happen are all events molded and shaped by God Himself. This sounds good on the surface, but there are inherent and very concerning issues with God's character in this worldview. Now, you may be asking, "*what about sin and evil; did God ordain Hitler to kill 6 million Jews?*" And I would commend you for asking this, because these are the very questions we should be asking when testing the spirits (1 John 4:1). However, the unnerving answer to this question--at least under the umbrella of divine determinism and the proponents thereof (namely Calvinists)--is a resounding *yes!*. But is this deterministic worldview a rational explanation of God's response to humankind that we can glean from Scripture? 

### Origin of Determinism Within Christianity
Such beliefs as Stoicism, Gnosticism, and Manichaeism all taught a form of divine determinism in the first several centuries of Church history but were not taught within the Church itself. It wasn't until Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) rolled onto the scene where all this changed. His influence of divine determinism dropped a nuclear bomb within Christianity to which the fallout is still seen to this very day. Interestingly enough, before his conversion to Christianity, Augustine was a Manichean gnostic who believed in, taught, and defended determinism! After his conversion, and for the first 25 years of his Christian walk, he taught the same teachings of the early Church fathers: freedom of the will. But it wasn't until the final 18 years of his life that his Manichean teachings started to rear its ugly head and surface like a slow-rising stagnant swamp bubble. But the bubble clearly didn't pop fast enough. Enter Calvinism... 

#### The Reformation
Let's take a ride in our DeLorean and notch the "time dial" to the early years of the Reformation. Protestants eventually split from the Catholic Church (1517 AD), and a theologian by the name of John Calvin (1509-1564 AD) emerged from the depths of the *Swamp of Divine Determinism* and helped shape the theology of the West. The very father of Calvinism himself was influenced by Augustine and his teachings on predestination and divine determinism (Calvin quoted Augustine's writings over 4,000 times, so to say he was influenced is probably a massive understatement). In one of his writings, Calvin stated, in more or less words, that the early Church fathers were confused in their teachings on free will:

> *"Further, even though the Greeks above the rest--and Chrysostom especially among them--extol the ability of the human will, yet all the ancients, save Augustine, so differ, waver, or speak confusedly on this subject, that almost nothing certain can be derived from their writings."*

In essence, Calvin is *agreeing* that the early Church fathers unilaterally taught free will. What he goes on to say is that every early Church father and, subsequently anyone who believed their teachings in free will, were confused for the first several centuries of Church history. Think about that. These people he's referring to are the same Christians that studied *directly* under the Apostles Paul, Peter, or John (Christians such as Ignatius (35-108 AD), Polycarp (69-155 AD), Clement of Rome (35-99 AD), etc.).

Ironically enough, highly respected Reformed scholars even today, such as Loraine Boettner, agrees with Calvin's point that determinism wasn't seen in Christianity until towards the end of the 4th century (in other words, it wasn't seen before Augustine)<sup>[[1]](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/boettner/boettner_calvinism.html)</sup>:

> "*...the doctrine of Predestination was not made a matter of special study until near the end of the fourth century. The earlier Church fathers...taught that salvation was through Christ; yet they assumed that man had full power to accept or reject the Gospel.*"

Yet another respected Reformed scholar, Herman Bavinck, had come to similar conclusions as Boettner and Calvin:

> "*In the early Church, at a time when it had to contend with pagan fatalism and gnostic naturalism, its representatives focused exclusively on the moral nature, freedom, and responsibility of humans and could do no justice, therefore, to the teaching of Scripture concerning the counsel of God. Though humans had been more or less corrupted by sin, they remained free and were able to accept the proffered grace of God. The Church's teaching did not include a doctrine of absolute predestination and irresistible grace.*"

Calvinists and other Reformed scholars *themselves*--the same people that typically hold to a deterministic worldview--conclude that these teachings were altogether absent in the early Church. Well, at least we're not putting people to death anymore that oppose determinism, right? (*cough*, *cough*)

#### Calvin's Opponents
Well, we don't talk about that. We don't talk about people like Michael Servetus, someone who critiqued and resisted some of Calvin's teachings, who Calvin said he would put to death in his letter to Farel if he saw the man face to face<sup>[[2]](https://www.reenactingtheway.com/blog/john-calvin-had-people-killed-and-bad-bible-interpretation-justified-it)</sup>: 

> "*Servetus offers to come hither, if it be agreeable to me. But I am unwilling to pledge my word for his safety, **for if he shall come, I shall never permit him to depart alive**, provided my authority be of any avail.* (emphasis added)" -- Letter to Farel, 13 February 1546

Unfortunately for Michael Servetus, he met his fate promised by Calvin. Servetus was burned alive<sup>[[3]](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Servetus)</sup>. And, yet this isn't the only ungracious, ungodly, un-Christ-like act Calvin committed against his opponents. Consider this next quote from Calvin as a build-up to his next victim (spoiler alert):

> "*I am persuaded that it is not without the special will of God that, apart from any verdict of the judges, the criminals have endured protracted torment at the hands of the executioner.*" -- Calvin's letter to Farel on 24 July

Calvin was unfortunately a man of his word. Jacques Gruet, who was a theologian who disagreed with John Calvin, wrote him a letter in which he called Calvin a hypocrite and a heretic. In the only natural response to these accusations, John Calvin had Jacques tortured inhumanely every day for a month before finally "showing mercy" and having Jacques beheaded<sup>[[4]](https://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc8/hcc8.iv.xiii.xii.html)</sup>. What a prime example of Christlikeness, Calvin. 

### Determinism’s Influence Today
Enough of Calvin, I wanted to show who the man was behind the mask of modern-day determinism. But I digress. Let's jump back in our DeLorean and transition to more modern times.

Calvinism is still running rampant with teachers such as John Piper, John MacArthur, Paul Washer, Voddie Baucham, James White, etc. Not much has changed in the way of divine determinism, as you can see with a horrifically heretical, utterly abhorrent quote from John Piper: 

> "*God... brings about all things in accordance with His will. In other words, it isn’t just that God manages to turn the evil aspects of our world to good for those who love Him; it is rather that He Himself brings about these evil aspects for His glory (see Ex. 9:13-16; John 9:3) and His people’s good (see Heb. 12:3-11; James 1:2-4). This includes—as incredible and as unacceptable as it may currently seem—**God’s having even brought about the Nazis’ brutality at Birkenau and Auschwitz as well as the terrible killings of Dennis Rader and even the sexual abuse of a young child**...* (emphasis added)"

This is pure blasphemy to ascribe such evil to originate from a holy, righteous God--who is often called things in Scripture such as "love" (1 John 4:8) and "light" (1 John 1:5). But, sadly, leading Calvinists, so long as they're consistent with their theology, adhere to this same exact form of determinism which turns God into a moral monster. But never mind the fact that God Himself, in His own words, said He doesn't decree abhorrent acts such as child sacrifice through Baal worship (Jeremiah 19:5), but He decreed the murder of 6 million Jews, the rape and sexual abuse of innocent victims, and every other godless act? Yes, except child sacrifice, though. That apparently is where God draws the line in Calvinism.

Here's another quote from E.H. Palmer, who also affirms the notion that God ordains sin: 

> "*Nothing in this world happens by chance. God is in back of everything. He decides and causes all things to happen that do happen.  He is not sitting on the sidelines wondering and perhaps fearing what is going to happen next. No, he has foreordained everything 'after the counsel of his will' (Ephesians 1:11): the moving of a finger, the beating of a heart, the laughter of a girl, the mistake of a typist – **even sin**.* (emphasis added)" -- The Five Points of Calvinism, Grand Rapids, Baker, 2009, p. 30

I wonder if either John Piper, E.H. Palmer, or the Calvinists that hold to this level of determinism have ever studied the Council of Orange? In 529 AD, in one of the anathemas (a formal "curse") pronounced against heretical doctrine, the council had this to say those that believe God ordains sin<sup>[[5]](https://yieldtogod.org/the-canons-of-the-council-of-orange/)</sup>:

> "*We not only do not believe that any are foreordained to evil by the power of God, but even state with utter abhorrence that if there are those who want to believe so evil a thing, they are anathema.*"

Yikes! Now, it's important to mention that I am aware Calvinism isn't monolithic. Not all Calvinists might hold to this same horrid view of God. But at its very core, determinism must be accepted to some degree in Calvinism for it to remain in accordance with its own teachings of TULIP<sup>[[6]](https://reformed.org/calvinism/tulip-an-introduction-by-jonathan-barlow/)</sup>: **T**otal Depravity, **U**nconditional Election, **L**imited Atonement, **I**rresistable Grace, and **P**erserverance of the Saints.

Finally, we'll examine another similar thought from Paul Helm, who many consider to be one of the leading Calvinist philosophers of today:

> "*Not only is every atom and molecule, every thought and desire, kept in being by God, **but every twist and turn of each of these is under the direct control of God**. He has not, as far as we know, delegated that control to anyone else*."

## Logical Problems with Determinism
### Contradicting God's Nature
If God is controlling our very thoughts, thoughts that are wildly contrary and unbecoming of a holy God, then isn't that a low view of God? That makes God the author and controller of sin. How does this not make God evil? Consider this: why is it true for someone with the intent of carrying out a crime that they're tried for the crime even if it's not carried out? For example, if someone was found to have written a letter which stated they had the intent of murdering someone--to where they even have the gruesome details planned out--that person will be tried for a conspiracy to commit murder. But that same logic doesn't apply to the God of Calvinism? If the God of Calvinism, even as stated by leading Calvinists themselves, is the true God of Christianity, then we are all in deep, deep trouble. 

We have a deceptive, untrustworthy deity on our hands. Our very separation from God is not due to our own sin (Isaiah 59:2), but the sin that God determined us to commit. This doesn't hold up to Scripture or basic logic. First, God cannot sin (1 John 1:5). God also hates sin (Psalm 5:4-5, Psalm 26:5, Psalm 11:5). Therefore, why would He ever decree, predetermine, or ordain humans to do what He Himself **cannot** do, and what He Himself **hates**? Isn't that hypocritical? That would undeniably make us liars if we did that, another thing that God cannot do (Numbers 23:19, Titus 1:2, and Hebrews 6:18). Us being called imitators of God (Ephesians 5:1), how can we effectively imitate a deity that is decreeing and ordaining thoughts and actions (a lot of times being very evil) for us? We are called to abhor evil (Romans 12:9), but we can't do this if we're imitating a God who causes us to do evil.

Consider a quote from an early Church father, Basil the Great (329-379 AD), which stated:

> "*If the origin of our virtues and of our vices is not in ourselves, but is the fatal consequence of our birth, it is useless for legislators to prescribe for us what we ought to do, and what we ought to avoid; it is useless for judges to honor virtue and to punish vice. **The guilt is not in the robber, not in the assassin; it was willed for him; it was impossible for him to hold back his hand, urged to evil by inevitable necessity**.*"

Basil's description of determinism sure sounds like Calvinism, doesn't it?

### Contradicting God's Will
If it's God's will that none would perish (2 Peter 3:9) and that all are saved and come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4), then why would He arbitrarily choose certain people (before the foundation of the world) to be damned into hell for all eternity? How is God not going against His own will? Jesus told us that "a house divided against itself cannot stand (Mark 3:25)." This is a contradictory, paradoxical double-speak in the form of a self-refuting statement where God's will is completely divided against itself within determinism. It cannot be said that God's will is that all repent and are saved through the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ, but then also be said that God chooses arbitrarily who will and won't be saved. Then that's clearly not God's will... You don't need to attend Logic 101 to understand that is an illogical statement of the highest degree.

### Contradicting God's Character
One of the main themes of God's character seen throughout Scripture is Him being a just Judge (Genesis 18:25). Essentially, determinism teaches that God decides and causes our choices, but then He punishes us for the very choices He decreed for us to have. Why? If we had no say in the matter, how can we be held accountable for it? Let's use an analogy to clear things up. Imagine there's a king. A servant comes into the king's court one day and the king grabs ahold of him, forces him against his will to drink a potion which causes the servant to curse and renounce the king. The king then puts the servant to death because the servant cursed and renounced him. Is the king just to put the servant to death; is the servant to blame? Of course, not (on both questions), the king forced the servant to do something against his will that he might not have done otherwise. Well, what if the king *secretly* slipped the same potion into the servant's drink every day until one day the servant did the same thing and cursed and renounced the king? Is it right in this sense because the king did not overpower the servant like in the previous case? In both scenarios, we can rightly surmise that the king is not a just or a fair leader to his servant, but an evil one. And the servant is not to blame because these actions are not coming from him but are controlled from an external source. This is determinism. This is Calvinism.

Let's examine this a little deeper. What's the antonym of "just"? Unjust. [Merriam-Webster's thesaurus](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/unjust) has these words listed as synonyms for "unjust":

* unfair
* unreasonable
* arbitrary

Notice "arbitrary" there? That term alone flies in the face of God's character and contradicts Calvinism's claim that God arbitrarily and unconditionally elects certain for salvation and others for damnation. God cannot be just, as Scripture suggests (Isaiah 45:21) and as the very words of the definition suggest, if He acts unfairly, unreasonably, or arbitrarily.

### Contradicting God's Word
How can we trust that we have inspired words from God if He is determining all things from our very thoughts to our every action? No matter how hard you appeal to the words contained in the Bible, there's nothing that can be done to escape the fact that the words have empty meaning. Remember when God tells the children of Israel that He was setting before them good and evil and for them to choose good (Deuteronomy 30:15,19)? All choices similar to this found in Scripture are useless. Choices to repent and believe, choices to walk uprightly and practice holiness--these don't matter. All the commands are also useless. Commands to believe, love God, and love one another--these also don't matter. And they don't matter because they're not things that we do; they're things God causes us to do or not to do; so why even have them written on the pages of Scripture if everything is already determined for us? 

### Contradicting the Gospel
The redemptive work on the Cross makes zero sense in divine determinism--the very Gospel itself. If God ordained the fall through the sin of Adam, and God determined to redeem mankind and our corruption from sin (also something he caused and determined) through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, then why would God have ordained Adam to sin to begin with? Why command humans to repent and believe if He is the one ordaining our repentance and belief? Why have Jesus sent to the Cross? Is God determining to redeem His own determinations? Let that sink in.

Even the word "gospel" is contradicted in Calvinism. The word "gospel," meaning,

* glad tidings, or
* good news

cannot be "glad tidings" or "good news" in Calvinism. Imagine you're on the street and you share with someone the "good news" of divine determinism. 

> **Person1**: "Hey, want to hear some good news?"<br>
> **Person2**: "Yes, I'd love to!"<br>
> **Person1**: "Okay, here's the bad news first. You're a wicked sinner deserving punishment in hell. But here's the good news: God made a way for you to be saved. He unconditionally elects certain people to be saved, but there's absolutely no way that you can know if you're one of them, it's just fully left up to God."<br>
> **Person2**: "Oh... so, what happens if I'm not elect?"<br>
> **Person1**: "Oh, you'll be going to hell forever for sure. It's not like God really *neeeeeds* to save anyone, though. Anyways. Isn't this good news?!"

### Contradicting Its Own Teachings
But, oh the irony. John Piper's next quote is so theologically inconsistent and is so self-defeating to itself, it's as though watching a teen attempting to sneak out of the house, but he gets caught when he forgets about the window alarm. Here's what our clumsy teen, John Piper said when asked if God decreed sin:

> "*Yes. Every horrible thing and every sinful thing is ultimately governed by God. That's a problem, but the center of the solution of the problem is **a choice you have to make about the cross**.*" 

So, let me get this straight: God caused man to sin. God then wanted to redeem His own determination to cause man to sin. So, God became flesh in the form of the Lord Jesus Christ to die for the sin that He ordained to begin with. God then causes some people to reject the message of salvation and will eventually punish them for their rebellion in hell forever, which was also ordained for them to do by Him. But then He requires for everyone to make "a choice about the Cross," a choice also governed by Him which cannot be made by themselves. Then, God punishes the same people that He chose to make the wrong choice that He caused them to make out His own decree in the first place?

### Contradicting Rebellion and the Devil
If God ordained all things, including sin and the devil's rebellion, and God is in control of all that the devil did, does, and will do, then the devil is only as evil as God made him to be. Doesn't logic tell us that God (in a deterministic worldview) is the author of evil? The devil can only do what God predestined him to do. Determinism makes God to be more evil than the devil. And not only the devil, but this same thinking would apply to every single human being on earth--we all can only be as evil as God made us to be. But God doesn't cause us to sin, so how can this be true (James 1:13-15)? In my humble opinion, Calvinism is treading a *verrry* thin line of blaspheming the Holy Spirit (Mark 3:29-30) by attributing evil and sin to God. I've heard Calvinists claim that *God can bring good from evil events, though*. I wholeheartedly believe that and agree--and there are examples of that in Scripture; however, God isn't bringing good from evil events in this situation, God is *bringing* and *creating* the evil events Himself. That's my problem and my point of contention. 

## Calvinism = Determinism = Fatalism
Britannica has a good definition of [fatalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fatalism) where they mention:

> "*fatalism, the attitude of mind which accepts whatever happens as having been bound or decreed to happen...doctrines of fatalism may be described loosely as synonymous with determinism, but it is useful to make a distinction. Whereas determinism can be represented as compatible with moral responsibility ["moral compatibility" as some Calvinists teach], fatalism properly understood would reduce practical ethics to nothing but the advice that humans should resign themselves indifferently to the course of events.* (added portion in brackets)"

If you listen long enough to most Calvinists, you might notice they don't teach determinism so much as they do fatalism. And how could they not? Their very doctrine of election, i.e., God choosing some for salvation and the rest for damnation is 100% out of our control and we are, like Britannica defines, reduced to nothing other than resigning ourselves indifferently to His choosing. Determinism is just many bypasses on the same highway of fatalism. Take for example the recent Christian deconversion of Derek Webb, the lead guitarist of Christian band [Caedmon's Call](https://www.caedmonscall.com/). 

{% include responsive-embed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORYcoIpIQSw" ratio="16:9" %}

In the 58:00 to 59:34 minute mark, his last chilling quote is what I wanted to focus on: "*maybe God made me and fashioned me for destruction*." This is pure fatalism. And this is truly the way that Calvinists view God. It's no wonder Derek Webb deconverted from Christianity. This is precisely what Calvinism leads to. The only difference between fatalism and Calvinism is that Calvinists refuses to accept their own implications of TULIP and what it leads to.  

## Conclusion
No other doctrine, in my estimation, impugns and maligns the character of God than that of divine determinism, i.e., Calvinism. Tracing Calvinism back to its father, John Calvin, we can see clear-as-day rotten fruit to begin with: A man responsible for the senseless torture and killings of many that opposed his teachings. Fast forward to modern times, we don't have killings occurring anymore, but what we do have are people killing their own faith through deconverting. Calvinism leads to fatalist thinking in cases seen in individuals such as Derek Webb, where they sadly believe that nothing is up to them, it's already predetermined and ordained--down the very thoughts, actions, and even sin. Calvinism creates a deity more evil than the devil and is one so deceptive that it cannot be trusted.

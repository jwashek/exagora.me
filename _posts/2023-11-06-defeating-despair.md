## Intro
If you've sinned, are lies being whispered in your ears: "*God has abandoned you*," "*God won't forgive you*," "*It's impossible to be reconciled to God*, etc.? When a Christian sins, it's so easy to sink into despair and drown within the thick, murky waters of spiritual turmoil. Like walking endlessly through a revolving door, we just can't seem to believe God has forgiven us--or that He ever will--so the (un)natural response of many Christians is to abandon the faith altogether. This sad state of despair is as though we've been fed a plate of lies and our appetite now only lusts for a food that will never satisfy us. When we repeatedly feed on despair, we fall deeper into turmoil and are grabbed by its forceful and unrelenting hand. Seemingly, the only way to loosen the grip is to give in. And nothing gives the devil more joy than this; keeping a child of God into a state of despair. Because he knows the longer a Christian remains locked in the dark room of their own oppressive thoughts, they'll blindly feel for the door to escape. I hope to provide even a shred of light in that dark room to show you that God has not abandoned you, even if you've abandoned Him. He's in the room with you and He is holding a lamp, showing you the way out. 

## Hope For the Sinner
Maybe you've just sinned. Maybe you're haunted by your past sins? A distant past or a not-so-long-ago present, despair pays no mind. 

Lift up your head and look down the road. There's two paths set before you: Hope and Despair. Will you do what many Christians do and choose the latter? Maybe it's a repeated sin? Maybe it's a more grievous sin? Maybe it's a past sin that you can't seem to get over? Regardless of the reason, none of that matters: you choosing despair is what the devil wants. Your situation is never so hopeless that God won't reconcile you through His boundless grace and unending mercy. The gospel gives hope to the hopeless and is just as much for the believer than for the unbeliever. The Lord Jesus didn't die for the sins of mankind only to turn the valve of His cleansing faucet off for those who've already come to the River and drank from it. His River has no need for a faucet, it's always running. All we must do is come and drink; humble yourself in repentance, confess your sin before the Lord and be restored out of your despair.   

### Examples of the "Hopeless"
The Bible gives us wonderful examples of the "hopeless"; wicked and rotten sinners once in the favor of God, fell from His grace, and later received reconciliation through God's mercy and grace.

**Manasseh** - Manasseh quite possibly may have been *the* most wicked king (2 Kings 21:1-20 and 2 Chronicles 33:1-20) by committing mass murder, leading Judah and Jerusalem into idolatry, desecrating the temple of God by building altars for false gods, committing sorcery and necromancy, etc. These acts that Manasseh committed were certainly ones that should have had him put to death under the Mosaic Law ten times over. However, we read in his story how it took Manasseh to be carried off in chains by the enemy for him to finally humble himself before the Lord in repentance. But when he did, God restored his kingdom back to him. Manasseh could have buckled under fear and cowered before the piercing eyes of despair which stared grimacingly at him, but he chose a different route. Manasseh gazed upward; past the demon of despair and chose to see the beaming rays of sunlight dancing behind a dark cloud. Manasseh put his hope and trust in the Lord in a state that many would have given up; a state where he didn't allow himself to feel the wind of despondent whispers passing between his ears: "*you're unsaved*," "*you've outsinned God's grace*," "*God will never forgive you now*"... these fleeting thoughts passed like a dream which is forgotten before the morning.

**David** - David, a man after God's own heart (1 Samuel 13:14 and Acts 13:22), started as a valiant man of renown who later became king. This same David, who defeated Goliath (1 Samuel 17:45-51) and conquered many nations (2 Samuel 8:1-14), had a problem which almost conquered him. David committed adultery with a married woman and then had her husband murdered after news of her pregnancy was revealed to him (2 Samuel 11). Surely this David couldn't repent of such horrific and abominable sin, right? David didn't let thoughts such as those conquer him and drag him into a pit of despair. David already defeated Goliath, but Goliath is but a child compared to the opponent of "*Despair*." Wrapped in impenetrable armor, larger in stature than an unscalable mountain, *Despair* is an enemy that is impossible to conquer. David didn't see an unconquerable enemy, though, he peered into his hand and saw his weapon of "*Hope*" glimmering before him. Just a broken dagger in comparison to the great sword of his enemy's. But hoping in the Lord allowed David to see through the paper armor of "*Despair*", crushing his enemy like an ant under his foot. A seemingly impenetrable armor can be sliced cleanly with even the dullest bit of hope; an unscalable mountain is a dirt pile which blows away from the flap of a bird's wing so long as we have just a shred of hope within us.

But how can we claim victory over despair like our examples of Manasseh and David, and the countless others found in Scripture?

## Defeating Despair
### Beat Your Opponent, Not Yourself
When a boxer falls down from a hard blow to the head, if they want to win the match, it wouldn't be very wise for them to stay down. What would be even more unwise is if they hit themselves in the head out of their own frustration for falling down. But that's exactly what you do when you fall into despair after you've sinned. Every "*I'm unsaved*" or "*God won't forgive me*" is yet another self-driven blow to your own head. You want to defeat despair? The first step is to get up. And keep getting up (Proverbs 24:16). We do this by humbling ourselves before God: "*Father, have mercy upon me a sinner.* (Luke 18:13)"  

### Just A Little Repentance
There's not a single reason to be patient in your repentance. Be impatient; trust in the goodness of God (Romans 2:4) and do it now. Even a little repentance is better than none at all. Your sin is not so unique that it's severed the very cord that anchors your soul in heaven. Sin never frays the cord, but despair does. It's only when we see the hand that caused the cord to fray--ours--that we can begin to understand the foolishness of despair. Don't cut your own cord, you may have slipped and dropped from your prior position, but your hands are still on the cord. Keep climbing upward, past the fray; eyes forward on the Lord Jesus. 

### Believe God Is...
#### Your Father
God is called our Heavenly Father (Matthew 7:11) over 40 times in just the New Testament. A distinction that we should be drawing, no doubt. But I fear the child of God who falls into despair forgets this truth. Like cleaning the dishes only to realize the table was full of dirty plates, we tend to leave things unnoticed when despair is aiding in our chores, yet despair becomes the very chore itself.

What good earthly father, when their child asks for their forgiveness will turn them away? What father would want to see their child continuing in despair even after asking for their forgiveness? Would an earthly father disown their child who disobeyed against them the same way 10 times in a day? Then what makes you believe our Heavenly Father will? Our Heavenly Father is compassionate, running towards us, the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32), and provides a feast for our return. The only sins God won't forgive you of are the ones you won't allow him to forgive you of. We don't allow him to forgive us by keeping them to ourselves and not confessing them before Him in repentance. We become the dog who catches the tennis ball and holds onto it, never returning it to its owner. We clutch our sin so closely that the noticeable imprint is left in our grip, leaving our fingers mangled and unusable. Let go of your despair, or it will never let go of you.

#### Your Good Shepherd
Oftentimes, Christians read Psalm 23 and can even recite it from memory in a lot of cases. But, like the morning dew which almost seems to dry from the warm breath of scurrying animals, it never seems to stay clung to the blades of the grass for very long. Just the same, Christians read this Psalm but tend to overlook that this Psalm applies directly to us; we are the sheep, God is the Shepherd. Taking the time to understand this Psalm's meaning, each verse is telling of how God is our good Shepherd. With Him leading our course, we lack nothing (Psalm 23:1), we enter restful places (Psalm 23:2), He removes our fears (Psalm 23:4), and He gives us a fortified place of protection (Psalm 23:6). And what's more, if we wander from the flock and away from the Shepherd, He will go and search for us until He finds us. And once He does, to ensure our safety and protection, He places us on His shoulders and leads us back home (Luke 15:4-5). Is this you? Have you sinned and roamed from your Shepherd? Have you wandered *completely* from the Shepherd? Return to Him; allow Him to carry you on His shoulders. He takes no pleasure in losing even a single sheep. 

### Finish the Race
No matter what you've done, how hard you've sinned, or for how long you've turned your back on God, it is *never* too late to return. You started the race, finish it. So long as you have air in your lungs you have time to repent, return, and be reconciled to God. Even if you wait until you're old and gray, that doesn't matter. What does matter is your return. Though we're not promised tomorrow (James 4:14), we are promised that it's not God's will that any perish, but that all come to repentance and are saved (2 Peter 3:9 and 1 Timothy 2:4).

Many start training for a race months in advance. Runners have no desire to quit halfway through the race. And they know it's not the start of the race that matters, but how it's finished.

### Desire Heaven, Not Escaping Hell
It's better to be a dimly lit star in heaven, than a bright flame in hell. When we shift our fears, it tends to put things in perspective. Be more terrified of being excluded from the beauty and splendor of the King's presence than fearing the torments of hell. We cannot even fathom all that God has in store for those that love Him (1 Corinthians 2:9). And if you were invited to the King's palace and caught but a glimpse of the inner hall through the crack of a keyhole into the glory and elegance of His dwelling, you would desire what your eye's laid hold of above all else. 

Imagine it. The doors to the kingdom open slowly, you're nearly blinded by a light so radiant and filled with glory that if your eyes could capture even a fraction of its luster, you'd light through unpierceable darkness with every blink. The King approaches you and says, "Well done, good and faithful servant (Matthew 25:21)," and He adorns you with thick, fine embroidered robes and swollen crowns constricted with so many precious jewels that we leave sapphire and rubies in our wake with every step. Beads of shining gold gather like raindrops as far the eyes can behold. You are captivated and overwhelmed by the sheer beauty that you've been left speechless since your arrival. The King leads you to a feast. He slides a chair for you that glides gracefully and effortlessly on smooth, pearled floors like a bird cutting through the air. The cup you hold in your hand is pure gold like transparent glass, you can't seem to lower your lips to it as you don't want to bring the tiniest smudge to its excellent beauty. 

I'm afraid even this scene is like comparing the scum of a stagnant, dismal pond to a glass of pure, ice-cold water from a hidden spring. Don't throw that away for your refusal through despair to repent and return to the Lord. Don't let the doors of His kingdom close shut before you. The feeling of the wind pushing against your face resulting from the forceful closure of those heavy doors to the kingdom may be the last bit of fresh air you experience. The door is open now, don't allow your despair to watch the door close before you. 

### Have Hope in Hope
Ask yourself this question: *If those who swerved from the narrow path were forbidden to return again, how many people would fill God's kingdom?* Even if 10,000 people tell you there's no hope for you, I'm here to tell you that they're *dead wrong*; we have a God of hope (Romans 15:13) and He will always be the 1 against 10,000 patiently awaiting your return. Whose side would you rather be on? And when you do return, you can rest knowing God will in no wise cast you out (John 6:37) if you come to Him with a sincere heart of repentance (Psalm 51:17). But believing the lies of despair tells us otherwise--that God turns His back on us when we sin. God doesn't turn His back on us, it's us that turns our back on Him. It's not the sun going down and away from the earth, but it's the earth which moves and revolves around the sun. Despair, if it could, would ensure a new day would never come. This is why we must make it a pattern to get up and await the sunrise again. And do so until the Son does come and calls us home to meet Him in glory.

## Conclusion
You've sinned and fallen into despair. Thoughts of God not forgiving you are all too common and drive you into spiritual agony and turmoil. But no matter what you've done, how hard you've sinned, or for how long you turned away from God, He is awaiting your return. If you have breath still in your lungs, there's time for you to repent and be reconciled to the Lord. There are so many examples of sinners in Scripture being healed and forgiven of their sin by God's unending mercy and grace, so why does that exclude you from His same loving compassion? It is only too late when you're in the grave, so don't wait until then--there's no room for repentance there, but there's always room for repentance right now. Make your return today, the Lord is waiting for you with arms wide open to embrace you in His tender care and love. Run to Him in repentance; seek His mercy and forgiveness, He will in no wise, *never*, cast out a sinner humbling themselves in repentance who seeks His mercy.

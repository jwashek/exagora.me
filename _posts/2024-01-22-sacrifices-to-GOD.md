## Intro
As Christians, we tend to look back at the Old Covenant and we breathe a sigh of relief: we're thankful that we no longer have the need to present animal sacrifices to the LORD. But the New Testament teaches us that we aren't all that *done away with* sacrifices. It might no longer be animals, but we still present sacrifices to GOD, just in a much different manner.

## Spirit and In Truth
In John chapter 4, the Lord Jesus is speaking with a Samaritan woman. She mentions that they and the Jews worshiped in different places, making the Lord Jesus respond that, "*the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father* (John 4:20-21)." He continues that the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24).

In other words, worship is no longer confined to a physical place (i.e., a mountain or a temple). Along these same lines, the glory of GOD no longer dwells in temples above the mercy seat (Exodus 25:21-22), but rather, within the believer themselves (1 Corinthians 6:19 and 1 John 4:12-13,15). This is important to understand the correlation of physical vs spiritual--we no longer worship on a mountain or in Jerusalem (physical), but now in spirit and in truth (spiritual). Since GOD is spirit, we must worship in spirit. Since GOD is love, we must worship in love (1 John 4:16). The Jews offered physical worship--circumcision, animal sacrifices, etc. We offer ourselves spiritually. *We* are the sacrifice.

## The Christian's Sacrifices
### Contrition
Our first offering of sacrifice is by way of contrition. Psalm 51:17 tells us that the sacrifices of GOD are a broken and contrite spirit. That word, contrite, is the Hebrew word ["dāḵâ"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1794/kjv/wlc/0-1/) meaning, "to be crushed; to be broken." To be contrite is to have a strong feeling of remorse or guilt. Contrition and repentance (change of mind) go hand-in-hand. Scholars have suggested that contrition leads to repentance. While contrition is remorse and a condemnation of one's sins, repentance is the act of changing your mind which leads to an amendment of your ways. This sacrifice to the Lord is our way of presenting ourselves humble; showing Him that it's His way, not ours.

### Praise and Thanksgiving
In life, there are many ups and downs. Just the same, when someone is broken and contrite, there's always an upside. Hebrews 13:15 tells us exactly what this upside is: praise and thanksgiving. Which is the Christian's next sacrifice. This might sound counter-intuitive, but when contrition has torn through your chest and gripped your heart with its rough, calloused hands, only then can you fully grasp the reality that you've been forgiven. The only natural thing to do from there is to rejoice through praising and giving thanksgiving to GOD. Regardless of what led us to a state of contrition and brokenness, we must find whatever state we are in to be content (Philippians 4:11) and to declare His works with rejoicing (Psalm 107:22).

### Giving to Those in Need
When you're in a state of rejoice through praise and thanksgiving, a reasonable inclination might lead you to the next sacrifice of the Christian: sharing and giving to those in need. GOD is well pleased when we share our resources with others (Hebrews 13:16). When we do so, we must realize that we're not lending to the person but lending to the Lord (Proverbs 19:17). Unlike what our selfish ambitions might teach us, we did not do anything to create wealth for ourselves. Every good thing we've received is from the Lord (James 1:17). And we must be willing to be actionable with the resources GOD has blessed us with, if not, how can we claim to love GOD or love others (1 John 3:17-18)?

### Our Whole Self
We give our resources such as money, time, and energy as a sacrifice to GOD, showing our love for Him and for others. But there's one thing we present as a sacrifice by way of withholding. And that's our bodies. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit Who lives within us. It is for this reason that we must give glory to GOD through our body (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) and present ourselves as a living sacrifice to the Lord (Romans 12:1). We do this by fleeing and abstaining from sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18 and 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5) and not using our bodies as instruments leading to sin, but rather, as instruments leading to righteousness (Romans 6:13). Not only do we abstain from using our bodies in sexually immoral ways, but we are commanded to abstain from all appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22-23).

In his Homilies on the Gospel of St. John, St. John Chrysostom (347-407 AD) mentioned this:

> "Sacrifice then not sheep and calves but dedicate thyself to the Lord; make thyself a holocaust, this is to offer a living sacrifice. Ye must worship in truth; as former things were types, such as circumcision, and whole burnt offerings, and victims and incense, they longer exist, but all is truth. For a man must now circumcise not his flesh, but his evil thoughts, and crucify himself, and remove and slay his unreasonable desires."

### Our Actions
But abstaining isn't everything when we sacrifice to the Lord. Sometimes, we need to give sacrifice by doing. For example, Proverbs 21:3 tells us that doing righteousness and practicing justice is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. GOD desires mercy as the Word says in Hosea 6:6. The word used for "mercy" in the Hebrew is "[ḥeseḏ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2617/kjv/wlc/0-1/)" which means *goodness; kindness; faithfulness*. We can't show mercy in any other way than through action; through doing. In other words, mercy and showing love to others do not come through our lips, but through what we do (1 John 3:18).

## Conclusion
As Christians, we are called to bring sacrifices to the Lord. We don't bring physical sacrifices in the form of animal offerings anymore, but rather, spiritual sacrifices. We are now a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices such as contrition, praise and thanksgiving, being giving to those in need, by abstaining from sexual immorality and other sin, and by way of showing love through action. These sacrifices enable us as believers to no longer have to wait for a high priest to offer physical sacrifices for sin for us. We are able to offer these spiritual sacrifices ourselves to GOD through Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Peter 2:5).

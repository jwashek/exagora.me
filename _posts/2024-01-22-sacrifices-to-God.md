## TL;DR
In the Old Covenant, God was worshiped through animal sacrifice. Sacrifices are not done away with during the New Covenant--just the method. As Christians, we present *ourselves* as a living sacrifice to God. We sacrifice to God through contrition, praise and thanksgiving, doing righteousness and acting with justice, and giving to those in need. God doesn't desire physical sacrifices, but spiritual.

## Spirit and In Truth
In John chapter 4, the Lord Jesus is speaking with a Samaritan woman. She mentions that they and the Jews worshiped in different places than them, making the Lord Jesus respond that, "*the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father* (John 4:20-21)." He continues that the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24).

In other words, worship is no longer confined to a physical place (i.e., a mountain or a temple). Along these same lines, the glory of God no longer dwells in temples above the mercy seat (Exodus 25:21-22), but rather, within the believer themselves (1 Corinthians 6:19 and 1 John 4:12-13,15). This is important to understand the correlation of physical vs spiritual--we no longer worship on a mountain or at a temple (physical), but in another sense, we still do. We just present our bodies as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1-2) since our body *itself* is a temple to God (spiritual). And since God is spirit, we must worship in spirit. Since God is love, we must worship in love (1 John 4:16). The Jews offered physical worship--circumcision, animal sacrifices, etc. We offer ourselves spiritually. *We* are the sacrifice.

## The Christian's Sacrifices
### Contrition
Our first offering of sacrifice is by way of contrition. Psalm 51:17 tells us that the sacrifices of God are a broken and contrite spirit. That word, contrite, is the Hebrew word דָּכָה  ([dāḵâ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1794/kjv/wlc/0-1/)) meaning, *to be crushed; to be broken.* To be contrite is to have a strong feeling of remorse or guilt. Contrition and repentance (change of mind) go hand-in-hand. Scholars have suggested that contrition leads to repentance. While contrition is remorse and a condemnation of one's sins, repentance is the act of changing your mind which leads to an amendment of your ways. This sacrifice to the Lord is our way of presenting ourselves in humility; showing Him that it's His way, not ours. And, our Lord Jesus said Himself that we must humble ourselves like little children or else cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 18:3-4). 

### Praise and Thanksgiving
In life, there are many ups and downs. It's easier to complain and be irritated when things aren't going our way and to rejoice when they are. However, Philippians 4:4 tells us to "*rejoice in the Lord always.*" Why? Rejoicing leads to praise and thanksgiving, which Hebrews 13:15 tells us is a sacrifice to God! When you're feeling down, rejoice! When things aren't going your way, count it all joy (James 1:2-3)! Don't think of rejoicing as you receiving something, but as you giving something. And you're giving it to God. Whatever state you're in, find yourself content (Philippians 4:11), and declare His works with rejoicing (Psalm 107:22). In calling to remembrance His works that He's done for you in your life, how can you not rejoice? Even in just realizing the depth of forgiveness you've received from your sins--this will lead you to "*love much* (Luke 7:47)." And, in turn, will cause you to rejoice much.

### Giving to Those in Need
Sharing and giving to those in need is something God is well pleased with (Hebrews 13:16). And He desires this over burnt offerings and sacrifices (Hosea 6:6). The word used for mercy in the Hebrew isחֶסֶד  ([ḥeseḏ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2617/kjv/wlc/0-1/)) which means: `goodness; kindness; faithfulness`. When we do good, show kindness, and are faithful to others, we're lending our resources to them: our time, talents, and finances. Unlike what we might tell ourselves, we did nothing to create wealth for ourselves. Every good thing we've received is a blessing from the Lord (James 1:17). And we must be willing to be actionable with the resources God has blessed us with to others who are less fortunate--if not, how can we claim to love God or love others (1 John 3:17-18)? Contrary to what we might realize, we're not always lending to those in need, but we're also lending to the Lord (Proverbs 19:17). 

### Our Whole Self
As Christians, we do a lot of our sacrifice to God through giving, however, we can also sacrifice to God through withholding. And that's with our bodies. Our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit Who lives within us. Keeping our body pure and undefiled is a sure way to present an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord; however, the opposite is true. Using our bodies for impurity and defilement to our passions leads to the destruction of our temple (1 Corinthians 3:17). It is for this reason that we must give glory to God through our body (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) and present ourselves as a living sacrifice to the Lord (Romans 12:1). And one way in which we do this is by fleeing and abstaining from sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18 and 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). Another way is to not use our bodies as "*instruments leading to sin*," but rather, as "*instruments leading to righteousness* (Romans 6:13)." Not only do we abstain from using our bodies in sexually immoral ways, but we are commanded to abstain from all appearance of evil (1 Thessalonians 5:22-23)--and this pleases our Heavenly Father.

In his *Homilies on the Gospel of St. John*, John Chrysostom (347-407 AD) mentioned this:

> "Sacrifice then not sheep and calves but dedicate thyself to the Lord; make thyself a holocaust, this is to offer a living sacrifice. Ye must worship in truth; as former things were types, such as circumcision, and whole burnt offerings, and victims and incense, they longer exist, but all is truth. For a man must now circumcise not his flesh, but his evil thoughts, and crucify himself, and remove and slay his unreasonable desires."

### Our Actions
Proverbs 21:3 tells us that "*doing righteousness and practicing justice*" is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. The Hebrew word צְדָקָה  (([ṣᵊḏāqâ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6666/nkjv/wlc/0-1/)) used to translate righteousness holds the meaning, according to Strong's<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong%27s_Concordance)</sup>:

```
rightness (abstractly), rectitude (subjectively), justice (objectively), virtue (morally) or prosperity (figuratively)
```

Doing righteousness holds different meaning in different contexts; however, it can be summed up as "doing what's right." We can't show mercy or do righteousness in any other way than through action; through doing. In other words, mercy and showing love to others do not come through our words, but through what we do (1 John 3:18). And when we do this, we are ensured of a better sacrifice to God.

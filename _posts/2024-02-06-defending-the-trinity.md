## Intro
The Trinity is an often-confused topic for many Christians. Typically, we get tripped up when asked questions regarding the Trinity, which is interesting because it's so fundamental to the faith. So fundamental in fact that we had the [Nicene Creed](https://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/109020/Nicene-Creed.pdf) develop all the way back in 325 AD. This council was formed to address the Arian heresy, which was a teaching of Arius, who propagated the idea that the Lord Jesus Christ was a created being and wasn't co-eternal or co-equal with GOD the Father. In other words, Arius and his followers, were denying the deity of Christ--to which the early church held much different views of His divinity.

## Defining the Trinity
Before we begin examining common objections and providing rebuttals, we must first define what exactly we mean by the Trinity. Quite simply: GOD is one being in three persons. A "being" is the quality that makes you *what* you are, while a "person" is the quality that makes you *who* you are. For example: we are humans. That's what we are, but not who we are. What we are is composed of flesh, body parts, muscles, tendons, bones, etc. But all of that is not who we are. Who we are is composed of our own individual qualities--generous, kind, loving, humorous, caring, compassionate--we're unique in person. 

Humans are one being in one person, but He is one being (GOD) in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). And here's where we can examine our first question, "*How can GOD be three persons, but still be one?*"

## Questions
**How Can GOD Be Three Persons but Still Be Considered One Being?**<br>
We must start by understanding that human logic only goes so far. Revelation needs to take us the rest of the way. Understanding the Incarnation and Ascension will help a great deal in the way of understanding the doctrine of the Trinity. For example, Jesus is GOD who took on flesh (Philippians 2:5-11)--this is the Incarnation. Once the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected, He ascended to the right hand of the Father and *that's* when the Holy Spirit poured out upon men (Acts 1:5, Acts 2:1-4) at Pentecost. In other words, the Trinity wasn't fully realized until the Incarnation and Ascension with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

But to answer this question in a different way, Trinitarians do believe GOD is one; no one would refute that. But, to allude to a previous point in the last section, what exactly does this "one" consist of? One nation consists of many individuals. One car consists of 4 tires, a couple doors, an engine and many other parts. One family may consist of a husband, a wife, and a child. They all may be a part of the "Smith" family, but they are separate in function and person. 

**How Can We Believe the Trinity When Nothing in Creation Reflects It?**<br>
If we're dealing with a GOD that is believed to exist outside of creation, wouldn't it suffice to say that the way in which He exists transcends our comprehension if we're dealing with a Being that is beyond comparison or beyond comprehension? The fact that nothing else in creation reflects it is begging the question. If I created a computer and all of its components and protocols, would I, the creator, need to be applied to my creation? In other words, would I need to speak in binary, would my communication require ports and cables, and would I require extra hard drive space if I wanted to learn new concepts? The fact that we don't understand an aspect of GOD doesn't mean that it is untrue. Scientists don't even know what energy is[[<sup>source</sup>]](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/science/continuum/Pages/usingenergy.aspx#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20energy%20has,all%20different%20forms%20of%20energy.) but we all agree it's a valid truth in our universe.

**How Can the Trinity Be Real If Singular Personal Pronouns Are Used for GOD In the Old Testament?**<br>
Singular pronouns such as "He; Him" are used throughout the Bible to describe actions GOD has done, is doing, or will do--this is true. An example of this can be seen in Deuteronomy 3:22, where it says, "*the LORD your GOD Himself (or "He" in the KJV) fights for you.*" "Himself" or "He" are these examples singular personal pronouns. In any case, singular pronouns can also be used for a collective group. Let's look at Psalm 130:7-8 as an example. It says the following:

> **7** O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is abundant redemption.<br>
> **8** And He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

Israel in this context is referring to the nation of Israel, yet "*his*" is in the singular. Singular pronoun usage doesn't prove the non-Trinitarian case; however, plurals refute it. For example, in Genesis 20:13 (KJV), the verb "*to wander*" is used in the 3rd-person plural, meaning the term or phrase (in this case, "to wander") refers to a person or thing other than the writer/speaker and the person being addressed by the writer/speaker. In other words, this can be read as, "*They caused me to wander from my father's house...*" Let's take a look at a few more examples:

* **Psalm 149:2** - "*Let Israel rejoice in Him that made him*." The "Him" is a plural participle which means the participle possesses gender, number, and state. In this case, it's in the plural state, not singular.
* **Ecclesiastes 12:1** - "*Remember now, your Creator*." Same as above; "Creator" is a plural participle.
* **Isaiah 54:5** - "*For your Maker...*." Same as above; "Maker" is plural participle. 

**How Are We Made in the Image of GOD Yet We Aren't Multiple Persons?**<br>
Adam wasn't referred to as a single person either. Adam and Eve were referred to as "man" in Genesis 1:26-27. Male and female both share in the same being (Genesis 5:2). We are different persons in the same being as humankind.  

## Answering Non-Trinitarian Defenses
**Agents Are Often Used and Speak on Behalf Of GOD**<br>
This is a common defense from the non-Trinitarian position when they claim the Angel of the LORD in the Old Testament was just an agent of GOD. Some non-Trinitarians also use this argument in suggesting the Lord Jesus was an agent of GOD as well. However, this is somewhat true in the sense that agents can speak on behalf of GOD. But agents never claimed to be GOD. For example, Paul never said he was Jesus since he was an agent speaking on the behalf of Jesus. Why does this matter? Because in Judges 13:17-22 when Manoah asked the Angel of the LORD his name, the Angel replied, "*why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful*?" The original Hebrew word for "wonderful" is "[pil'î](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6383/kjv/wlc/0-1/)", which means "wonderful; incomprehensible; extraordinary". Now what's interesting is in Isaiah 9:6--one of the most frequently cited Messianic passages referring to the Lord Jesus--uses the word "[pele'](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h6382/kjv/wlc/0-1/)", coming from the exact same root as pil'î used to translate, "Wonderful." Why would an Angel ever suggest their name is incomprehensible; hard to understand, when Angels such as Gabriel and Michael give their names freely? In that same passage in Judges, after the Angel of the LORD ascends in the flames, Manoah and his wife fell on their faces on the ground--a sign of worship that would certainly be unacceptable to be given to a mere angel. And if there were still any questions, what Manoah said to his wife in verse 22 is very telling: "*we shall surely die, because we have seen God!*" The exact same word ("[ĕlōhîm](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h430/kjv/wlc/0-1/)") that's used over 2,000 times when referring to GOD. 

**The Trinity Isn't in the Old Testament**<br> 
There are passages such as Isaiah 63:10-11, where it mentions the Holy Spirit. What's interesting here is the fact that we see the Holy Spirit being grieved; i.e., experiencing emotions. This personalizes the Holy Spirit and distinguishes His person. And since He experiences feelings, this means He isn't simply energy as some non-Trinitarians claim. But in other passages, such as 2 Samuel 23:2-3, you'll notice the Spirit and GOD are both equated as performing the same action. For example, David says the following: "*The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me*..." and then he continues to say: "*The God of Israel...spoke to me*..." and then he proceeded to say the words what GOD had said. There is a clear distinction even in these two passages between the Father and His Holy Spirit. But let's go a little further. 

In Genesis 18, when Abraham is talking to the LORD and the two angels, it is clear there are three people speaking with Abraham (Genesis 18:1-8). What's important not to miss about this are two things: (1) the three ate food (Genesis 18:8), which will be important later, and (2) two of them left towards Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:22). What occurs directly after is Abraham talking, face-to-face, with the LORD ("*Abraham still stood before the LORD*"). What follows is the negotiation between Abraham and the LORD (Genesis 18:23-32). Before we move to verse 33, let's skip ahead to Genesis 19:1. You can clearly see that *two* angels arrived at Sodom and Gomorrah. This makes sense because we saw the "two men" leave just prior to this while the LORD (one of the original three who ate the food which Abraham and Sarah prepared) remained speaking with Abraham. Let's go back to chapter 18. Now, just before the men were going to depart for Sodom and Gomorrah, it says they stood up and faced the general direction of the city (Genesis 18:16), but just before the two men left, the LORD also said He was going to Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:21). And we see Him doing this in Genesis 18:33, He goes His way and arrives at Sodom and Gomorrah. Once there, Genesis 19:24 says the following: "*Then the LORD rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the LORD out of the heavens.*" Did you catch that? The LORD (the One who was here on earth, who ate with Abraham and the two angels) is said to call fire and brimstone from the LORD out of the heavens.

The last defense against this question may be the most striking. In Exodus 33:18-20, Moses asks GOD to show him His glory. He then says that Moses cannot see His face and live. If we fast forward to the book of Acts in chapter 7, Stephen is giving his address for people's claims that he was a blasphemer to the high priest. Stephen is recalling the exact story we just examined of Moses with the burning bush, but pay careful attention to Acts 7:30,35,38. Stephen says several times that it was the Angel of the LORD who spoke to Moses; Going back to Exodus, why would a mere angelic being cause death to those who look upon him and how would he be able to have compassion and mercy upon people (Exodus 33:19) if it wasn't GOD? In other words, no creature, angel or otherwise, has the power to have mercy upon mankind or has the ability to pardon transgressions (Exodus 23:20-21) other than the LORD. People in the Old and New Testaments fear angels, but they certainly don't fear to the point of death by simply looking upon them.

**How Can Jesus Say, 'The Father Is Greater Than I' If He Was Equal to Him?**<br>
If we say the President is greater than us, we'd be correct only in the sense that his role of authority is greater than ours. But what isn't true is that the President is any more human than us. We are perfectly equal in humanity, but vastly different in role. Our being is the same, but our person is much different. 

If the Lord Jesus didn't have equal divinity with the Father, then how was Stephen able to say, "*Lord Jesus, receive my spirit* (Acts 7:59)" as he was being stoned to death? Also, is it not interesting how that verse says that Stephen was "*calling on God*" just before he said those words? There's a similar Old Testament reference to this found in Psalm 31:5, where David says he commits his spirit to GOD. We cannot commit our spirits to anyone but the one, true GOD, so why did Stephen call out to the Lord Jesus if didn't think He was GOD?

Another interesting counter to this claim is found in 1 Peter 1:10-11. Peter says that the Spirit of Christ was in the prophets when they prophesied of the grace that was coming to the world. How can that be so if the Lord Christ was born after the prophets which prophesied of Him? It's because of His preeminence (Colossians 1:15-18).

**The Holy Spirit Is Never Said to Be GOD**<br>
One of the more interesting New Testament stories is when Ananias and Sapphira stole money and, when caught, lied about it. Shortly after they were struck dead. However, we get an interesting phrase from Peter in Acts 5:3-4 where he said, "*Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit*," and then he later says, "*you haven't lied to men, but to GOD*." It is inferred in this text that the Holy Spirit, who was the Person being lied to, is GOD. 

## Conclusion
The Holy Scriptures teach us the truth of the Trinity in showing us the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Just because the Bible doesn't mention the word "Trinity" doesn't mean that there's no truth to it. So, the next time someone claims you're a pagan Trinitarian, hopefully you're more equipped to defeat these arguments with rebuttals using Scripture as your foundation.

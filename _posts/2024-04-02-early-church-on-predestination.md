## Intro
The early church fathers, especially that of the ante-Nicene era (prior to the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD), viewed the topic of predestination much differently than what's espoused by the majority of those who hold to Reformed doctrine today. What the early Christians believed was not God electing some to salvation and damning others through reprobation by arbitrary means (i.e., divine determinism, Calvinism, believers holding to Reformed doctrine, etc.), but rather, the early Christians taught free will and God's choosing as a result of His foreknowledge. Prior to Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD), this teaching of divine determinism was utterly absent in early Christianity--and on the contrary, was seen only in Gnostic teachings.

## Early Church Quotes on Predestination
### Justin Martyr (100-165 AD)
> "But lest some suppose, from what has been said by us, that we say that whatever happens, happens by a fatal necessity, because it is foretold as known beforehand, this too we explain. We have learned from the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man’s actions. Since if it be not so, but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power." -- First Apology, Chapter 43

Notice Justin's phrases: "fatal necessity" and "happen by fate." He is speaking directly against fatalism, which is a hard pill you have to eventually swallow if you hold to exhaustive divine deterministic theology (i.e., Calvinism and other camps within Reformed theology). 

> "For He fore-knows that some are to be saved by repentance, some even that are perhaps not yet born." -- Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 62

This quote is almost the crux of what the ante-Nicene fathers believed. God's not predestinating through random choosing, He's predestinating through His divine foreknowledge. Or, to put it another way, predestination is a direct result of His foreknowledge. This is precisely where Calvinistic proof-texts such as Romans 8:29-30, 1 Peter 1:2, and Acts 2:23 crumble. It's right there in those very texts: "*...whom He foreknew, He also predestined...*", "*...elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father...*", "*...by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God...*". It's through His foreknowledge of events that God predetermines things. This is how the early church fathers understood it, such as what's seen in the next quote:

> "So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men." -- First Apology, Chapter 44

Along a similar theme to the previous two quotes, Justin makes it abundantly clear in this next quote that punishments were foretold in the prophets as a direct result of God's foreknowledge on those who would be unchangeable in their ways:

> "But that you may not have a pretext for saying that Christ must have been crucified, and that those who transgressed must have been among your nation, and that the matter could not have been otherwise, I said briefly by anticipation, that God, wishing men and angels to follow His will, resolved to create them free to do righteousness … .  But if the word of God foretells that some angels and men shall be certainly punished, it did so because it foreknew that they would be unchangeably [wicked], but not because God had created them so.  So that if they repent, all who wish for it can obtain mercy from God." -- Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 141 

### Irenaeus of Lyons (130-202 AD)
> "But God, foreknowing all things, prepared fit habitations for both, kindly conferring that light which they desire on those who seek after the light of incorruption, and resort to it; but for the despisers and mockers who avoid and turn themselves away from this light, and who do, as it were, blind themselves, He has prepared darkness suitable to persons who oppose the light, and He has inflicted an appropriate punishment upon those who try to avoid being subject to Him." -- Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 4.39:4

This belief from Irenaeus seems to align with Acts 17:26-27, which details how God has determined, preappointed the times--and even the places--of all people from every nation, tribe, and tongue that dwell on the earth, have dwelled on the earth, or will dwell on the earth. It's His will that we all seek Him, but as Irenaeus mentions, the preparations for those who oppose the light have been made as a result of His divine foreknowledge. 

### Tertullian (155-240 AD)
> "Therefore, we say that things will be, not because they are fated to be, but because they are foreknown to be. Yet it does not follow that they are therefore necessary. For there is no necessity that what is known to be done should on that account be done necessarily." -- Against Hermogenes, Chapter 33

Tertullian rejects the notion that just because God knows what will happen, those events are directly controlled and determined to happen. He distinguishes between foreknowledge and exhaustive divine determinism (i.e., "fated to be"). God's knowledge of future events does not remove human freedom or agency in bringing about those events. And we can see a clear example of this in Scripture. In 1st Samuel, David is fleeing from Saul and comes upon the city of Keilah. Saul finds out and is going to destroy the city and David. David consults with the LORD and asks Him if the people of Keilah will deliver him into the hands of Saul and the LORD says, "Yes, they will deliver you." But they didn't deliver David, and this never came to pass because David fled the city (1 Samuel 23:9-13). God knew what would happen if David stayed, but He also knew what would happen if David fled.

> "For whatever He made He foreknew: the difficulties of man's position, the wickedness of his nature, the snares of the devil, the danger of the world, the vast power of the flesh, the slender resources of the law; that He might prepare remedies beforehand against the event of our urgent necessities." -- Against Marcion, Book II, Chapter 13

This is precisely how the early church believed it to be when they read 1 Peter 1:20 and how the Lord Jesus was "*foreordained before the foundation of the world*." In His divine foreknowledge, like Tertullian mentions here, God even prepared the remedies beforehand--the Cross! Why, you might ask; if God knew this, why even make the world the way in which He did? Why not just have made things perfect since He foreknew we would fall into sin? First, free will. We are creatures endowed with the ability to make free choices. And with that, comes the risk of making bad choices. God knew this but decided to create the world anyways. Why? Love. Free will and love are wound together in perfect harmony. If God is love and wanted creatures to express that love, He could not have made them controlled by predetermined actions and deeds. That's not love, that's a robot. Another way of putting it would be to say: there is no love without free will and there is no free will without love. A world of free individuals who could choose to love Him purely out of their own free choice is better than a world in which He creates and causes them to love Him, then punishes the very acts and choices that He determined them to make.

> "For although God knows all things, and nothing can be concealed from Him, yet He does not impose [necessity] upon our will. So that we should not become the authors of our own evil by our intention, and of our good by necessity; for in that case virtue would be none at all." -- Against Marcion, Book II, Chapter 5

Tertullian sums up my previous point beautifully: He gives us free will but doesn't impose on it. If He did, what would all the warnings equate to in Scripture? Why do we all face judgment if our actions and choices are predetermined by Him?    

## Calvinistic Theology = Gnosticism
> "And certain of those who hold different opinions misuse these passages, themselves also almost destroying free-will by introducing ruined natures incapable of salvation, and others saved which it is impossible to be lost." -- Origen (185-253 AD), De Principiis (Book III)

Notice here how Origen essentially speaks against the **T** (Total Depravity) of [TULIP](https://carm.org/about-theology/what-is-tulip-in-calvinism/) and the doctrine of "Once Saved Always Saved." Gnostics were those who held to these doctrines and thought there was nothing that can be done for a saved person to be lost, and nothing that a lost person can do to be saved. Sound like Calvinism? Since I can't link all quotes from the ante-Nicene fathers, I would highly encourage reading Origen's [De Pricipiis (Book III)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04123.htm) and especially Irenaeus' [Against Heresies](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103.htm) for a more comprehensive view into Gnostic teachings in the early centuries. In so doing, you will quickly see the overlap between modern-day Calvinism and early Gnostic beliefs... if you haven't already noticed.

The Gnostics were known to misuse and abuse passages as proof-texts to prove we don't have free will (much like Calvinists today). For example, Origen continues:

> "Pharaoh, they say, as being of a ruined nature, is therefore hardened by God, who has mercy upon the spiritual, but hardens the earthly."

This is very interesting if you're familiar with Calvinistic doctrine. Replace "ruined nature" and "earthly" with "reprobate" and "spiritual" with "elect" and you have the exact same thing that Calvinists teach today. This quote from Origen against the Gnostics is truly Calvinism 101. 

The Marcionites, a Gnostic sect, also used "God hardening Pharaoh's heart" to prove their doctrine of determinism. Here's a quote from Irenaeus explaining his response against that belief:

> "If, therefore, in the present time also, God, knowing the number of those who will not believe, since He foreknows all things, has given them over to unbelief, and turned away His face from men of this stamp, leaving them in the darkness which they have themselves chosen for themselves, what is there wonderful if He did also at that time give over to their unbelief, Pharaoh, who never would have believed, along with those who were with him?" -- Ante-Nicene Fathers vol.1 pg. 502

This is quite a *nail-in-the-coffin* quote from Irenaeus. This is precisely what Irenaeus is describing in why some remain in unbelief; they've been turned over to unbelief since they never would have believed and "*which they have themselves chosen for themselves*" anyways. And in His foreknowledge, God can choose to interact with us based upon that foreknowledge. 

Another way of looking at this would be understanding the Hebrew word for "hardened", [ḥāzaq](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2388/kjv/wlc/0-1/). This word means "to strengthen", or in other words, God giving Pharoah over to his own devices and allowing more freedom in his own choosing. Think of it like this, if you put a lump of wax and a lump of clay to sit in the sun, one will melt (wax) while the other will harden (clay). Each of us has a heart of wax or clay, and through God's interaction with us, though He shines the same light of the same sun upon every individual, it is a heart of wax that will melt to His love or a heart of clay that will harden against it.

## Conclusion
The early church fathers, especially that of the ante-Nicene era, believed in God's divine foreknowledge as a result of His choosing things to come to pass. They denied fatalistic or divine deterministic doctrine as what's commonly espoused with Calvinism or those believers in Reformed doctrine. The focus on GOD's divine foreknowledge is their lens in how they viewed predestination. Their lens was not arbitrary choosing and this is abundantly clear in their writings. However, like with anything, don't take my word for it; read the ante-Nicene fathers works yourselves to get a more well-rounded understanding of their teachings.

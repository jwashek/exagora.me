## TL;DR
We are sick in sin, held in bondage to death, and have an enemy that tricked us into this bondage to begin with. The Lord Jesus Christ came to heal our sickness through providing His life as a ransom payment, thus redeeming us from death, saving us from sin, and defeating the power of the devil. His Cross was a rescue mission to save mankind--not a punishment against sin to appease an angry God.

## The Disease of Sin
We all have this fatal disease called sin which can be traced all the way back to Adam and Eve. Through Satan's temptation, Adam and Eve were deceived into sin, and thus, caused mankind's fall. With any disease comes unfortunate symptoms--sin not being an exclusion. Our three major symptoms are: 

* (1) death (Romans 6:23 and Romans 5:12); 
* (2) a broken and corrupted image, since man was made in the image of God (Genesis 1:26); and 
* (3) a separation from God (Isaiah 59:2). 

Our disease needed to be healed at its root; just healing the symptoms does nothing for taking away the disease, much like in modern medicine. And, unfortunately, this disease is highly contagious and *all* are affected by it (Romans 3:23 and Romans 5:12). Ever since sin entered into the world, mankind has been held into bondage and enslaved to its main consequence: death.

And if this wasn't enough, the enemy who caused this sickness upon mankind in the first place is the one who holds power over death (Hebrews 2:14)! Mankind was in dire need of saving and desperately deprived of healing. So, what was our Great Physician to do when he saw his beloved creation corrupted, diseased in sin, destroyed by death, and enslaved to the devil?

## Man's Enemies Defeated
He needed to bridge the gap from divinity into humanity and rescue mankind. The Cross of our Lord Jesus is not that of a somber, angry, retributive death (such as PSA espouses), but rather, it's the greatest rescue mission of all time! His incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension were the necessary acts performed to recapitulate mankind for all that was lost in the fall. The atonement was triumphant, heroic, and loving. This is how the disease of sin has been healed. This is how our image has been restored. And this is how we've been ransomed and redeemed--reconciled back to God the Father (2 Corinthians 5:18-21). Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift (2 Corinthians 9:15)!

### Christ, the Victor!
The Greek word for salvation, ("[sōtēria](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4991/kjv/tr/0-1/)"), has a root of "[sōzō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4982/kjv/tr/0-1/)." Sōzō means "to save; keep safe and sound" or is also defined as "heal; to make whole." Thus, the atonement (or, read this as "at-one-ment", i.e., what was needed to be "at one" with God the Father again) as a whole was necessary in order to save us, keep us safe and sound, and to bring about the healing and wholeness to our sick nature corrupted in sin. And what other way to destroy the corruption than through incorruption (Hebrews 2:14-18)? As Justin Martyr eloquently put it:

> "Corruption became inherent in nature. So, it was necessary that He who wished to save us would be someone who destroyed the essential cause of corruption. And this could not be done other than by the life that is according to nature being united to that which had received corruption. For this would destroy the corruption." -- Justin Martyr (c. 160 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I pg. 301

And, thus, the first piece of the atonement puzzle starts. The incarnation.

#### The Incarnation
The Word became flesh (John 1:1-2,14) and assumed human nature. Divinity and humanity came together in perfect union under one Person, the Lord Jesus Christ. This, what's called the [hypostatic union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostatic_union), is itself a beautiful picture or type of our reconciliation back to the Father. Christ didn't just assume human flesh, but *all* of humanity and *all* of divinity under one Person through one perfect union of the two. But, of course, the incarnation wasn't only symbolic, it was real, and it was necessary so that our reconciliation back to the Father could be made possible, that our disease could be healed, and that our image could be restored. The Lord Jesus assumed all of our humanity, from its flesh, its soul, and its mind, in order to bring a complete healing to it--or, as Gregory of Nazianzus puts it:

> "For that which He has not assumed He has not healed." -- Gregory of Nazianzus (329-390 AD), [Epistle 101 to Cledonius the Priest Against Apollinarius](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3103a.htm) 

In the very same way that Adam corrupted all of humanity in sin, the Lord Christ took on corruption in order to bring about all of humanity's healing and restoration:

> "For by no other means could we have attained to incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and immortality--unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility." -- Irenaeus (c. 180 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I pg. 448-449

Once immortality put on mortality, He needed to do what we all do: live out His life as a human.

#### The Life
Through Adam's disobedience, Christ lived obediently. He re-enacted human existence by perfect obedience, undoing the effects which Adam's fall brought to mankind through His life. Through Adam's sin, Christ was without sin (Hebrews 4:15). Through the 1st Adam, we were born under sin. Through the 2nd Adam, we can be born under Him and be made righteous (Romans 5:10,17-19 and 1 Corinthians 15:22). Humanity needed a 2nd Adam to cleanse us of our corruption, another "Adam" in who's life we could be born under (1 Corinthians 15:45-49). Christ's life is set forth as an example for us--teaching us how to be under perfect submission to our Father and His will (Matthew 16:24, John 14:15,21,23, John 15:12, Ephesians 5:2, 1 John 1:6-7, 1 John 2:6, and 1 Peter 2:21,24). But not only this, we see through the Lord Jesus' life that His miracles are very examples of this coming healing of our sickness' symptoms: casting out demons saps the power of Satan's kingdom; raising the dead weakens death's grip on man; and healing diseases, sicknesses, and countless infirmities were a prefigure of our many sins being healed by our Great Physician. 

Even though He was fully divine, He was also fully human--wrapped in the flesh of humanity. Thus, He needed to humble Himself to the point of death (Philippians 2:5-8) to continue His redemptive work for the sake of all humanity and its need of healing.

#### The Death
Through the tree, mankind fell. But through the tree of the Cross, mankind has been redeemed. By His death, He defeated the devil, who had power over death (Hebrews 2:14). But, He had to enter the realm of death itself and God cannot die. However, what if God takes on human nature (Philippians 2:7-8)? Then God can enter Hades and rescue mankind through dying (1 Peter 3:18-19). In other words, in order to free man, He had to become one. And so, the importance of the Cross is not to punish sin so that He can forgive sin (how PSA views the Cross). Rather, the Cross of our Lord Jesus gave God access to death itself; proving His ultimate love and sacrifice for humanity. By taking a body that can experience death, the Son of God entered down into Death and Death couldn't handle it (Acts 2:24). Why? The Lord Jesus Christ lived a sinless life, and since the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), how can Death hold a sinless Man to a consequence undue to Him? 

In all this, He overcame death by rising again!

#### The Resurrection
The resurrection is the hinge which swings the door of healing open for all of humanity. Without the resurrection, we are hopeless and would still be in our sins (1 Corinthians 15:12-20). If Christ was never raised from the dead, He never would have conquered death, His life as an example for us would have been meaningless as we'd still be under the curse of the Law (Galatians 3:10-13), and His act of redemption and reconciliation would have been an utter failure. Without the resurrection, Him being the "first-fruits" (1 Corinthians 15:20) to those asleep in the Lord means that no one's corruptible bodies could be raised incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:42-43,50-54), thus denying us entry into the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50) itself. The resurrection was crucial--to say the least.

> "This He did in order that, just as by death we fell into corruption, so by resurrection we might rise again to incorruption." -- Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170–235 AD), Treatise on Christ and Antichrist

As He arose, he fulfilled His prophetic words to His apostles (Matthew 16:21). And since He arose, we must set our minds on things above, since He is seated at the right hand of the Father (Colossians 1:3). In other words, His ascension (Hebrews 1:3). The final piece of the puzzle.

### The Ascension
An often-overlooked aspect of the atonement is the ascension. Through the ascension, He obtained eternal redemption for us, thus becoming the mediator of the New Covenant by entering into the Most Holy Place, heaven itself (Hebrews 9:12-15,23-28). This is how He became our mediator and why all power and authority over the earth was given to Him (1 Peter 3:22). Alternatively, without His ascension, we wouldn't have been receivers of the power from on High, the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5,8-9,2:1-4). Through the giving of the Holy Spirit, we wouldn't be empowered with the continual "medicine" for our sickness. The Lord came to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29), but this is a sickness that requires continual medication. It's a life of faith working through love (Galatians 5:6) and abiding in the Vine (John 15:4-10) which enacts the continual healing process within us. If you take medication every day to suppress an illness, what happens if you stop taking the medication? The same is true for our healing, it's not a one-and-done event; our healing is continuous and effected through a participation in His medication in which He provided to us: faith (John 3:16), faithfulness (John 15:4-10), obedience (1 John 2:3-4 and Luke 6:46), and love (Matthew 22:37-40, John 13:34-35, and Galatians 5:6).

## What About Substitution? 
So, what, there's just no substitutionary aspect of His atonement? Of course there is! However, the problem with atonement theories is that they all try to account for being a one-size-fits-all theory, but they're not. And they can't be. There is truth to all atonement theories, but Christians shouldn't divide and condemn others for opposing views. This topic has been understood in various ways throughout history. For example, the early church fathers for the first 1,000 years believed in the [Ransom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_theory_of_atonement#:~:text=The%20theory%20teaches%20that%20the,a%20result%20of%20inherited%20sin.), [Recapitulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitulation_theory_of_atonement#:~:text=In%20the%20recapitulation%20view%20of,life%20(including%20moral%20perfection).) or [Christus Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christus_Victor) theories of atonement. They just understood it as simply as the Bible taught it: we've been saved from our sins, Christ has ransomed us, He died on our behalf, and He is the victor over sin, death, and the devil.

Substitution as Christ's offering *on our behalf* is a Biblical concept (Romans 3:25, Romans 4:25, Isaiah 53:10, Hebrews 9:26, etc.), no one is denying it--nor could they. But His substitution **never** should be viewed as "in our place." For example, in any case where a verse mentions "Christ died for us", such as in John 10:11, the word "for" is the Greek preposition "[hyper](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5228/kjv/tr/0-1/)" which holds the meaning "in behalf of" or "for the sake of." This is reflected in one of the earliest Christian writer's letter to the Philippians. In this letter, Polycarp calls Christ's substitution the "earnest money of our righteousness" ([Polycarp 8:1](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/polycarp-lightfoot.html)). If you make an offer on a house, you have to put forward earnest money, or a down payment. The down payment shows you're serious. It's your pledge that you have the intention of paying off the loan. It's the very same thing where the Lord Jesus is showing His seriousness by putting His own life as a down payment "on our behalf" for all those who place their faith in Him.

But, what's the problem with "in our place"? This teaches that Christ suffered in our place to justify us, thereby condemning Himself in the process; His death was in our place to satisfy the wrath of an angry God who seemingly was so bloodthirsty to punish sin, He justified the wicked by condemning the Just. One problem with PSA is how it utterly contradicts Proverbs 17:15 which states **both** of these things as *abominations* to God (i.e., justifying the wicked and condemning the just). How can we assume this is what God requires for us to be atoned for if He finds those actions abominable? In addition, another contradiction can be found in Ezekiel 18:20 which teaches us that we all bear our own guilt and no one else's. How can God contradict this and require the contrary? Another major flaw in PSA is it completely destroys the Trinity, pitting the Father and Son against one another. PSA, in and of itself, is a non sequitur.

The Father is angry with our sin and needs to punish it. So, God sacrificed Himself to Himself to save us from commandments that we broke that He Himself laid out? So, the Son willingly comes to die in our place to undo everything? This portrays the Father in a very negative light and the Son in a positive one. And, not to mention, what is the benefit of us being reconciled to the Father in this atonement theory? It's as though the Lord Jesus is saving us *from* an angry and abusive Father, *to* the very One He's attempting save us from! There's a reason this view was absent in the early church and for the first 1,000 years until Anselm (1033-1109 AD) taught the [Satisfaction Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_theory_of_atonement), which PSA heavily borrowed from.

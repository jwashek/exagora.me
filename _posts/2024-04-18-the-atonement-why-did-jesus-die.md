## Intro
"Why would an omnipotent God need a human sacrifice in order to save people from their sin?" This is a very common question that skeptics raise to discredit or deny the existence of God. And, sadly, many Christians unwittingly agree to this claim and even defend this as "gospel." Or altogether they blindly accept this theory out of ignorance because it's the only thing they've been taught. This is an atonement view often referred to as [Penal Substitutionary Atonement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_substitution#:~:text=in%20older%20writings%2C%20called%20forensic,and%20propitiation%2C%20so%20God%20can). In short, this atonement theory suggests that Christ died *in our place* (this will be important later on) and, in so doing, satisfied God's wrath. But is there any truth to this claim? Is there a better way to understand the atonement? 

## Chief Enemies of Man
We all have this fatal disease called sin that will eventually bring death upon us since sin leads to death (James 1:15 and Romans 6:23)... and, well, *all* have sinned (Romans 3:23). Sin can be traced all the way back to Adam and Eve. Through Adam's sin, mankind fell. Through mankind's sin, we became enslaved to the devil and his power, unknowingly serving him within his own kingdom. Not only this, but the fall also brought other issues as well:

* Our image before God was corrupted and our nature was deep in sickness;
* Our sin drove a chasm of separation between us and God (Isaiah 59:2);
* Through our corrupted image, we have the proclivity towards sin (Isaiah 53:6) as well as being enslaved and in bondage to sin (John 8:32-36); and
* A new consequence was wrought upon us as a result of sin: death (Romans 5:12 and Romans 6:23).

And since the devil has power over death (Hebrews 2:15), man was enslaved to and in bondage under these three: sin, death, and the devil. In our fallen state, humanity needed a Savior to ransom us from our bondage to sin and to set us free. A Savior to rescue the righteous dead who were filing into Hades (Ephesians 4:8-10, 1 Peter 3:18-19, and 1 Peter 4:6). A Savior who would weaken the power of evil and bind the devil (Matthew 12:28-29), destroying him and triumphing over his kingdom and the rulers therein (Colossians 2:15). But, unfortunately, mankind needed to wait until this Savior came, so in the meantime, the Law was added as an emergency response towards sin which acted as our tutor and kept us under guard, supervising our life and morals until this Savior, the promised Seed, would come (Galatians 3:15-29). 

So, what was God to do when he saw his beloved creation corrupted, diseased in sin, destroyed by death, and enslaved to the devil?

## Man's Enemies Defeated
He needed to bridge the gap from divinity into humanity, enter the realm of death, Hades, and rescue mankind. The Cross of our Lord Jesus is not that of a somber, melancholic, retributive death, but rather, it's the greatest rescue mission of all time! His incarnation, life, death, and resurrection were the triumphant, heroic, loving recapitulation of mankind and all that was lost in the fall. This is how man was redeemed. This is how man was ransomed. This is how man was reconciled to the Father (2 Corinthians 5:18-21). Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift (2 Corinthians 9:15)!

### Christ, the Victor!
Humanity needed "salvation", to which the Greek word for salvation, ("[sōtēria](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4991/kjv/tr/0-1/)"), has a root of "[sōzō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g4982/kjv/tr/0-1/)." Sōzō means "to save; keep safe and sound" or is also defined as "heal; to make whole." Thus, the atonement as a whole was necessary in order to save us, keep us safe and sound, and to bring about the healing and wholeness to our sick nature corrupted in sin. What other way to destroy the corruption than through incorruption? As Justin Martyr eloquently put it:

> "Corruption became inherent in nature. So, it was necessary that He who wished to save us would be someone who destroyed the essential cause of corruption. And this could not be done other than by the life that is according to nature being united to that which had received corruption. For this would destroy the corruption." -- Justin Martyr (c. 160 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I pg. 301

And, thus, the first piece of the atonement puzzle starts. The incarnation.

#### The Incarnation
The Word became flesh (John 1:1-2,14) and assumed human nature. Divinity and humanity came together in perfect union under one Person, the Lord Jesus Christ. This, what's called the [hypostatic union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypostatic_union), is itself a beautiful picture or type of our reconciliation back to the Father. Christ didn't just assume human flesh, but *all* of humanity and *all* of divinity under one Person through one perfect union of the two. But, of course, the incarnation wasn't only symbolic, it was real, and it was necessary so that our reconciliation back to the Father could be made possible. In the very same way that Adam corrupted all of humanity in sin, the Lord Christ took on corruption in order to bring about all of humanity's healing and restoration:

> "For by no other means could we have attained to incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and immortality--unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility." -- Irenaeus (c. 180 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I pg. 448-449

Once immortality put on mortality, He needed to do what we all do: live out His life as a human.

#### The Life
Through Adam's disobedience, Christ lived obediently. He re-enacted human existence by perfect obedience, undoing the effects which Adam's fall brought to mankind through His life. Through Adam's sin, Christ was without sin (Hebrews 4:15). Through the 1st Adam, we were born under sin. Through the 2nd Adam, we can be born under Him and be made righteous (Romans 5:10,17-19). Humanity needed a 2nd Adam to cleanse us of our corruption, another "Adam" in who's life we could be born under (1 Corinthians 15:45-49). Christ's life is set forth as an example for us--teaching us how to be under perfect submission to our Father and His will (Matthew 16:24, John 14:15,21,23, John 15:12, Ephesians 5:2, 1 John 1:6-7, 1 John 2:6, and 1 Peter 2:21,24). But not only this, we see through the Lord Jesus' life that His miracles are very examples of this coming defeat of man's three chief enemies: casting out demons saps the power of Satan's kingdom; raising the dead weakens death's grip on man; and healing diseases, sicknesses, and countless infirmities were a prefigure of our many sins being healed by our Great Physician. 

Even though He was fully divine, He was also fully human--wrapped in the flesh of humanity. Thus, He needed to humble Himself to the point of death (Philippians 2:5-8) to continue His redemptive work for the sake of all humanity.

#### The Death
Through the tree, mankind fell. But through the tree of the Cross, mankind has been redeemed. By His death, He defeated the devil, who had power over death (Hebrews 2:15). This is significant because all the righteous dead were filing into Hades and Christ came to set them free. But in order to free the dead, He had to enter the realm of death itself. God cannot die, but if God takes on human nature (Philippians 2:7-8), then God can enter Hades and rescue mankind through dying (1 Peter 3:18-19). In other words, in order to free man, He had to become one. And so, the importance of the Cross is not to punish sin so that He can forgive sin. Rather, the Cross of our Lord Jesus gave God access to death itself; proving His ultimate love and sacrifice for humanity. By taking a body that can experience death, the Son of God entered down into Death and Death couldn't handle it (Acts 2:24). Why? The Lord Jesus Christ lived a sinless life, and since the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), how can Death hold a sinless Man to a consequence undue to Him? 

In all this, He overcame death by rising again!

#### The Resurrection
The resurrection is the hinge which swings the door of salvation open for humanity. Without the resurrection, we are hopeless and would still be in our sins (1 Corinthians 15:12-20). If Christ was never raised from the dead, He never would have conquered death, His life as an example for us would have been meaningless as we'd still be under the curse of the Law (Galatians 3:10-13), and His act of redemption and reconciliation would have been an utter failure. Without the resurrection, Him being the "first-fruits" (1 Corinthians 15:20) to those asleep in the Lord means that no one's corruptible bodies could be raised incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:42-43,50-54), thus denying us entry into the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50) itself. The resurrection was crucial--to say the least.

> "This He did in order that, just as by death we fell into corruption, so by resurrection we might rise again to incorruption." -- Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170–235 AD), Treatise on Christ and Antichrist

As He arose, he fulfilled His prophetic words to His apostles (Matthew 16:21). And since He arose, we must set our minds on things above, since He is seated at the right hand of the Father (Colossians 1:3) through His ascension (Hebrews 1:3). The final piece of the puzzle.

### The Ascension
An often-overlooked aspect of the atonement is the ascension. Through the ascension, He obtained eternal redemption for us, thus becoming the mediator of the New Covenant by entering into the Most Holy Place, heaven itself (Hebrews 9:12-15,23-28). This is how He became our mediator and why all power and authority over the earth was given to Him (1 Peter 3:22). Alternatively, without His ascension, we wouldn't have been receivers of the power from on High, the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5,8-9,2:1-4). Through the giving of the Holy Spirit, we wouldn't be empowered with the gifts of the Spirit (Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:7-11, and Ephesians 4:7-12) or be able to display the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). In addition, we wouldn't have the ability to have all things that pertain to life and godliness without the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:3). These gifts are not only a blessing to those who don't believe, which may help lead them to belief in the Savior (John 4:48) but should be used to build up and edify one another as acts of love (1 Corinthians 14:12 and 1 Peter 4:10). Of course, this all wouldn't be possible without the ascension of our Lord and King. Lastly, since He ascended, this could be seen as a precursor of His inevitable Second Coming to judge the living and the dead (Matthew 25:31-46, John 5:27-29, Romans 2:6-11, and Revelation 20:11-15).

## Still Doesn't Make Sense?
Sometimes it's beneficial to walk-it-back, moving from the end to the beginning, to get a better understanding if there's any confusion. So, let's do just that. Think of the atonement as a chain with every link perfectly fashioned together in one coherent connection from beginning to end. *Every* aspect of the atonement is crucially necessary and cannot coexist without all the elements. 

Had our Lord not ascended, our atonement would be incomplete since He never would have entered into the Holy Place in heaven with His own blood, thereby securing His place as our Mediator and Advocate (1 Timothy 2:5 and 1 John 2:1). The link to the resurrection would be snapped. Had the Lord not resurrected, we would have no hope in our resurrection in rising to incorruption. Resurrection’s link to His death would be removed. Had our Lord not died, death would still have humanity held in bondage. The link to His life would be peeled away. Had our Lord not lived a sinless life, the link to His death is rusted and frayed along with the link to His incarnation. And had our Lord not come in the form of humanity, we would still be in the 1st Adam with our nature utterly corrupted and sick in sin. Man's three chief enemies of sin, death, and the devil would still be reigning over us to this very day.

## What's Our Response? 
We're either *in Adam* or *in Christ*. Our response to the atonement is to be in Christ. And how we do that is by the following:

* Repenting and believing (Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15, Luke 13:3,5, John 1:12, John 3:15-16, John 3:36, John 5:24, John 6:47, Acts 3:19, Acts 16:31, Acts 17:30, Acts 20:21, and 2 Corinthians 7:9-10)
* Being baptized (Mark 16:16, John 3:5, Acts 2:38, Acts 22:16, Romans 6:3-4, Galatians 3:27, 1 Peter 3:21, and Titus 3:5)
* Living under the King's commandments (Matthew 5-7, Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 6:46, John 13:34-35, John 15:4-6,10, 1 John 1:5-7, 1 John 2:3-4, 1 John 3:6-10, and 1 John 3:23-24)

### Repent and Believe
You don't know you're under the wrong kingdom until someone tells you. You don't know what your sin causes and where it leads until it's brought to your attention. But this information comes to you, you must respond to the news through repentance (change of mind) and turning to Christ in faith (Romans 10:9-14 and Acts 20:21), as He is the Savior and only name under heaven through which salvation can be provided (Acts 4:12). 

### Baptism
Since we "must be born again" (John 3:3), how can we be reborn other than by first dying? And how is it that we die other than through baptism? We were all born under the 1st Adam slaves to sin. But when we're baptized into Christ (Galatians 3:27), we've been baptized into His death (Romans 6:3 and Colossians 2:12). We become born again and regenerated under the 2nd Adam through baptism (John 3:5, Titus 3:5, and Acts 2:38) and become descendants of His, no longer slaves to sin, but now slaves to righteousness (Romans 6:4-14). We die to our old ties in the 1st Adam through baptism--our death--and are born again once we rise from the waters--resurrected to new life in Christ--under the 2nd Adam. 

### Living Under the King
Part of the "Great Commission" (Matthew 28:18-20), in our Lord's own words, is to *make disciples* *teaching them to observe all things that [He] has commanded*. When we make the decision to follow Christ, we are under Christ and His authority as King. This means we are to obey what He commanded (1 Corinthians 7:19, Luke 6:46, and 1 John 3:23-24). Whether you like it or not, there's only two kingdoms. The kingdom of Satan, in which you were saved from (Colossians 1:13), or the kingdom of God. He redeemed us from the kingdom of the devil and released us from the bondage of sin. And how we understand redemption is key to understanding the significance of its relation to this and to the kingdom itself. The Greek word "[exagorazō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1805/kjv/tr/0-1/)" is used to translate the word "redeemed." This holds the meaning:

```
I. to redeem
  a. by payment of a price to recover from the power of another, to ransom, buy off
II. to buy up, to buy up for one's self, for one's use
```

This comes from two Greek words: "[ek](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1537/kjv/tr/0-1/)" and "[agorazō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g59/kjv/tr/0-1/)", which breaks down to the meaning: "out of the marketplace." Slaves were often traded in marketplaces in those days where someone would come and purchase the slave, thereby redeeming them from the previous owner and buying the slave for themself. We were bought and paid for by His own blood (Ephesians 1:7). We've been redeemed from our previous master, Satan, under his kingdom of sin, death, and hell and have been translated to the kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy (Romans 14:17). Therein is the good news: we can be under a new Master, one who has bought us with the price of His blood; one who has defeated sin and death; and one who has conquered our previous owner.

## What About Substitution? 
So, what, there's just no substitutionary aspect of His atonement? Of course there is! However, the problem with atonement theories is that they all try to account for being a one-size-fits-all theory, but they're not. And they can't be. There is truth to all atonement theories, but Christians shouldn't divide over which one more accurately depicts His sacrificial death for us and what was accomplished therein. This topic has been understood in various ways throughout history. For example, the early church fathers believed more in the [Ransom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_theory_of_atonement#:~:text=The%20theory%20teaches%20that%20the,a%20result%20of%20inherited%20sin.) or [Christus Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christus_Victor) theories of atonement. They just understood it as simply as the Bible taught it: we've been saved from our sins, Christ has ransomed us, He died on our behalf, and He is the victor over sin, death, and the devil.

Substitution as Christ's offering *on our behalf* is a Biblical concept (Romans 3:25, Romans 4:25, Isaiah 53:10, Hebrews 9:26, etc.), no one is denying it--nor could they. But His substitution **never** should be viewed as "in our place." For example, in any case where a verse mentions "Christ died for us", such as in John 10:11, the word "for" is the Greek preposition "[hyper](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5228/kjv/tr/0-1/)" which holds the meaning "in behalf of" or "for the sake of." This is reflected in one of the earliest Christian writer's letter to the Philippians. In this letter, Polycarp calls Christ's substitution the "earnest money of our righteousness" ([Polycarp 8:1](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/polycarp-lightfoot.html)). If you make an offer on a house, you have to put forward earnest money, or a down payment. The down payment shows you're serious. It's your pledge that you have the intention of paying off the loan. It's the very same thing where the Lord Jesus is showing His seriousness by putting His own life as a down payment "on our behalf" for all those who place their faith in Him.

But, what's the problem with "in our place"? This view, as aforementioned briefly, is Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA for short). This views Christ as suffering in our place to justify us, thereby condemning Himself in the process; His death was in our place to satisfy the wrath of God. The problem with this view (or more accurately, *one of the many problems with this view*) is it utterly contradicts Proverbs 17:15 which states **both** of these things as *abominations* to God: justifying the wicked and condemning the just, so how can we assume this is what God requires for us to be atoned for? In addition, another contradiction can be found in Ezekiel 18:20 which teaches us that we all bear our own guilt and no one else's. Again, how can God contradict this and require the contrary? Another major flaw in PSA is it completely destroys the Trinity, pitting the Father and Son against one another. PSA, in and of itself, is a non sequitur. Let me explain. 

The Father is angry with our sin and needs to punish it. So, God sacrificed Himself to Himself to save us from commandments that we broke that He Himself laid out. This portrays the Father in a very negative light and the Son in a positive one. And, not to mention, what is the benefit of us being reconciled to the Father in this atonement theory? It's almost as though the Lord Jesus is saving us from the Father, the very One He's attempting to reconcile us to. There's a reason this view was absent in the early church and for the first 1000 years until Anselm (1033-1109 AD) taught the [Satisfaction Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_theory_of_atonement), which PSA heavily borrowed from.

## Conclusion
A better way to understand the atonement is not that the Cross was punishment to Christ *in place of* our sins, but rather a triumphant rescuing of mankind *on behalf of* our sins. Humanity was in bondage to sin, death, and the devil and we needed a Savior. Through His incarnation, Christ took on corruption to defeat incorruption. Through His life, He undid the disobedience of Adam through His obedience to the Father. Through His death and resurrection, He defeated death, and was raised incorruptible to provide us the same path of incorruptibility--thus allowing us to inherit eternal life. And through His ascension, the Lord Jesus Christ entered into the Holy Place, heaven itself, having obtained eternal redemption for us. As a result, He became our Mediator and advocate and provided us the Holy Spirit and all graces contained therein for us to continue the work within His kingdom. Through the chain of redemption, all links of the atonement, man's three chief enemies were defeated: sin, death, and the devil.

## Intro
No matter how many times you cut down a weed, they will continue to grow. It isn't until you uproot them completely that they no longer plague your garden and stop sapping nutrients from the other plants. But, even when we do this, new weeds always seem to sprout up. This calls for us to turn to preventive measures--not only should we take care of the weeds at their source, but we also must take equal care to prevent regrowth. As Christians, we are branches to the Vine in the garden we must tend to, and we must be careful to take care of the inevitable weeds. 

### Sin Is a Weed
Much like a weed in a garden, sin starts the very same way. It's buried deep within us to where we don't take notice until it shoots through the surface. By then, it's too late as that weed will spread and quickly overtake even the most kempt of gardens. What is our response? What must we do to properly tend the garden of which we steward over?

## The Spiritual Garden
When we all heard the Gospel, the spiritual seed was implanted within us. Someone may have sown the seed, another may have watered, but God was the bringer of the increase (1 Corinthians 3:6-9). And He does this by our abiding in the Vine (John 15:1-2,4-6). Once we become a branch attached to the Vine, we are dependent upon the Vine and our being a branch is dependent upon the disposition of our soil (Matthew 13:3-9,18-23). If we want to be a strong branch to the Vine, we must ensure that we're bearing fruit and not being choked out by thorns and thistles (Hebrews 6:7-8). 

### Removing the Weeds From Their Source
As a branch, we must care for and tend to the Vine in many ways--not that it needs us, but that *we* need it--and if we want to grow and bear fruit, then there's no other way. However, even in our abiding to the Vine, if we're neglectful or careless, we can become barren and unfruitful (2 Peter 1:5-8). But one way we prove our care and concern of the Vine--showing our love for it--is by ensuring the surrounding soil is free from weeds. But instead of cutting weeds at the stems only for them to regrow and come back with a vengeance, we must take to the source of the weed--the root. And the key to our sin removal at its root lies in our Lord's own words in the Sermon on the Mount.

#### Extending the Law
Irenaeus (140 - 203 AD), a 2nd-3rd century Christian theologian, had this to say about Matthew 5:17:

> "...the Lord did not abrogate the natural [precepts] of the law, by which man is justified, which also those who were justified by faith, and who pleased God, did observe previous to the giving of the law, but that He **extended** and fulfilled them, is shown from His words. 'For,' He remarks, 'it has been said to them of old time, Do not commit adultery. But I say unto you, That every one who hath looked upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.'" -- Against Heresies, [Book IV, Chapter 13](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vi.xiv.html) (emphasis added)

Notice his word *extended*. This aligns fully with the Lord's comment just three verses later where He tells us we will, by no means, enter the kingdom of heaven if our righteousness doesn't *exceed* that of the Scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 5:20). Context doesn't allow for Him to be referring to His imputed righteousness, as most Protestants claim, but a literal obedience and following of what He was saying--or else He wouldn't have concluded the whole Sermon on the Mount with the words in Matthew 7:24-27. "*Therefore*," He says, "*whoever hears these sayings of Mine and does them*..." The Lord did not have imputed righteousness in mind, He had obedience in mind. The Scribes and Pharisees had the appearance of righteousness outwardly, but inwardly was another story (Matthew 23:27). Their sin was not on the surface, but within their hearts (Matthew 15:8). In other words, the Lord Jesus was telling us where the root of sin is. It's not the sin on the surface--adultery--but deeper: lust. And it's not murder, it's what leads to it: hatred. Without removing adultery at its source (lust), we'll never cleanse ourselves of all forms of sexual immorality. Without purging murder from its source (hatred) in our hearts, we'll be nothing but murderers. 

And many errantly say that we've been given commandments from God that are impossible to follow, and this is just yet another example of one. And I would agree... only if you have it in your mind that the commandment can't be kept to begin with:

> "I [said] to him, 'Sir, these commandments are great, and good, and glorious, and fitted to gladden the heart of the man who can perform them. But I do not know if these commandments can be kept by man, because they are exceeding hard.' He answered and said to me, 'If you lay it down as certain that they can be kept, then you will easily keep them, and they will not be hard. But if you come to imagine that they cannot be kept by man, then you will not keep them. Now I say to you, If you do not keep them, but neglect them, you will not be saved, nor your children, nor your house, since you have already determined for yourself that these commandments cannot be kept by man.'" -- Shepherd of Hermas (2nd century AD), [Commandment 12, Chapter 3](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02012.htm)

#### Faithful Obedience
You see, the early Christians did not have the problem we make for ourselves in modern Christianity. And apparently the Apostle John had no problem either when he said, "Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (1 John 3:15)" It seems as though John took the Lord's words very seriously (and literally). When the Lord lays down a commandment, He isn't saying it because He knows it's impossible. Wouldn't that be dishonest of God? That would be like a man telling a dog to fold the laundry, then yell at, beat, and berate the dog for not being able to do so. He knew it wouldn't be able to fold the laundry, so why give the command? So, the dog would trust its owner more? But this is exactly what most Christians today claim: the commandments are intentionally impossible to point us to Christ; *we* can't keep them because *He* did. It's a dishonest view of God and it does a disservice to what the Lord has commanded to us clearly within Scripture. Besides this, if we claim we love Him, we will keep His commandments (1 John 2:3-4) and do what He said (Luke 6:46). How can we obey Him and claim to love Him if we say His commandments are impossible?

Keeping the Lord's commandments *is* how we exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees as the Lord said--and coincidentally, it's how we cut out sin at its root. But if we do the opposite and believe they're impossible to keep, just like the quote from the Shepherd of Hermas, we will never be able to keep them. And if we do that, we become lax with our sin and allow the small weed to grow into a large one; the large one to spread throughout the Vine, and before we know it, our branch is lifeless, barren, and nigh to being cut off and burned in the fire.

So, let's work on the root of our sin; not only what we see on the surface, but what lies beneath. Once we do, we can prevent its return.

### Preventing the Weeds
James 1:14-15 is a key passage in understanding how we can prevent the return of the weeds in our spiritual garden. This passage describes what happens in the cycle of sin. 

* **Step 1: Temptation** - "*But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.*"
* **Step 2: Transgression** - "*Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.*" 
* **Step 3: Termination** - "*And sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.*"

Understanding this, the obvious desire is for us to always be in *Step 1* or at least to recognize what step we might be in at any given time. However, there are clues in Scripture as to how we can stay and *Step 1* and not allow the cycle to push forward. But the clue isn't *in* Scripture, it *is* Scripture! 

#### Scripture As Doers
By hiding the Word in our hearts, we have the ability to not sin against the LORD (Psalm 119:11). This is where the prevention starts. And by binding the commandments in our hearts and fashioning them like necklaces around ourselves (Proverbs 6:21-22), we can always be reminded so as to not sin against Him, thus preventing the weeds from further growth. We must keep His words and His commandments ever-present within us, tying them as symbols on our hands and foreheads; writing them on the very doorframes of our homes (Deuteronomy 6:1-9). This is truly being a *doer of the word*. The importance of being a doer of God's word (James 1:22-25) starts with us reading God's word; we can't be a doer if we never become a hearer. Don't run away from God's word, run to it. But, there is something else we should be running away from...

#### Running Away!
Genesis 39:1-12 tells the story of Joseph and Potipharâ€™s wife. In this story, Potiphar tries to seduce Joseph to lie in bed with her. As she grabbed him by his cloak, he resisted out of it, leaving it in her hands, and Joseph ran out of the house. There is no other response to temptation than this: we must run from it--far, far away. 

This is a common response to sin even in the New Testament. Several times we are told to run, or flee, from sin. We are told to flee from:

* Sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18 and 2 Timothy 2:22),
* Idolatry (1 Corinthians 10:14), and
* Greed and a love of money (1 Timothy 6:9-11).

Fleeing is something we should be doing as a response to sin and temptation; however, this is a sort of double-edged sword because fleeing can also be seen as resisting temptation. When we resist temptation, we're resisting the devil. So, not only are we fleeing from sin, but Satan is cowardly fleeing from us (James 4:7). Isn't that in and of itself the best prevention? Not only are we preventing the regrowth of weeds in our spiritual garden, but we are preventing the one responsible for sowing the weeds (Matthew 13:24-30) in the first place.

## Conclusion
Sin is a weed in the spiritual garden we tend to. We are branches of the Vine and need to ensure we're remaining therein to bear the fruit the Vine produces. One way we need to be careful we're tending to the Vine properly is by removing and preventing weeds--sin. Sin grows just like a weed, and it needs to be taken care of like a weed: plucked up from the root. We do this by understanding the true meaning of the Lord's words in the Sermon on the Mount--His extension of the law--and living in obedience to the Lord's commands. Preventing the weed's regrowth is done similarly. But we must *know* the commands by reading the Scriptures and hiding it in our hearts before we can become a doer of the Word. After this, we can flee from various forms of evil. In so doing, we will not only pluck the weeds from the garden, but further prevent them from being sown. As a result of our fleeing, the enemy sower will flee from us.

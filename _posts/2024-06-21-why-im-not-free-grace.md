## TL;DR
Free Grace theology is a novel sect within Christianity that holds to heretical teachings that lead to loose living with a complete disregard for repentance and ultimately can lead to antinomianism. The Free Grace views that are held today were absent in the early church, except with the Gnostics. 

## Free Grace
Free Grace<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_grace_theology)</sup> theology is a form of Christian soteriology<sup>[[2]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soteriology)</sup>--the study of salvation--which formed centuries after the Reformation (1517 AD) and was thought to have had its beginnings with Robert Sandeman (1718â€“1771 AD). This being a novel view of soteriology, along with its teachings, are why I am not Free Grace--though I believe God's grace is freely given to all who respond in faith to the Gospel. However, a lot of what's packaged in Free Grace theology was completely absent from the early church and beyond such as:

* Faith Alone
* Eternal Security
* Lack of Repentance
* Antinomianism

## Faith Alone
The phrase "faith alone" is never found in the Bible except in a negative context: "*You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and **not by faith alone**.* (James 2:24 (NIV), emphasis added)" So, are the apostle Paul--who says, "*therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law* (Romans 3:28)"--and the apostle James at odds? The apostle Paul is the same one who taught that faith means *nothing* if we don't have love (1 Corinthians 13:1-3); the same apostle Paul who taught nothing matters except that our faith works through love (Galatians 5:6) and that we keep God's commandments (1 Corinthians 7:19). 

The problem is cherry-picking a handful of verses to support a presuppositional view instead of using the whole counsel of God's Word. It's what the apostle Peter warned in 2 Peter 3:15-17. Many Free Gracers are guilty of doing this very thing: twisting Paul's words along with other Scriptures to their own destruction and to the destruction of those they're leading astray. They're the blind leading the blind (Matthew 15:14).

> "Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He says, 'Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord"...' For that reason, brethren, let us confess Him by our works, loving one another." -- Clement of Rome (35-99 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume VII p. 518

So, what's the real issue? An overemphasis on the mental assent to faith--and nothing else. "*Trusting 99% in the Lord Jesus and 1% in works will send you to hell*" and many other similar phrases are quoted ad nauseam to the point that you would think those have to be verses in the Bible. And since these phrases are parroted so frequently by Free Gracers, a new problem is introduced: Christians become seared to the notion that *anything* other than faith is a work. Repentance? A work! Baptism? A work! Obedience? A work! Ironically for the Free Gracer, our Lord said faith was a work (John 6:29), so how can we have faith if it's a work?

I digress. So, what's the logical conclusion to phrases such as that above? A bunch of fake professing Christians that are too scared to do the Father's will under the false pretense that it's works.

Was it not the Lord Jesus who said, "*but why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do the things which I say?* (Luke 6:46)" Free Gracers are dissuading others from living a life separated to the Lord Jesus Christ and reducing His commandments to mere suggestions by holding to a "simply believing" view that is void of works, void of repentance, void of love, and void of obedience. Let's call it what it really is: it's void of Christianity.

> "Let those who are found not living as He taught be understood not to be Christians, though they profess to be with their lips. It's not those who make a profession, but those who do the works who will be saved. This is according to His words: 'Not everyone that says to me, "Lord, Lord", will enter into heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.'" -- Justin Martyr (100-165 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I p. 168

### "I Never Knew You..."
Clearly, the commandments aren't mere suggestions are they? Our Lord mentioned in Matthew 7:21-23--what Justin Martyr is quoting from above--that not everyone enters heaven, but only those who do the will of the Father. What's ironic about this passage is that it completely destroys faith alone, because our Lord Himself said that we must be doing the will of the Father. Yet, Free Gracers love running to John 6:40 in support of their faith alone conjecture and say, "*See! The will of the Father is to believe!*" Yet they utterly ignore other passages speaking about the Father's will:

* to repent (2 Peter 3:9);
* to obey (Matthew 21:28-31)
* to abstain from sexual immorality (1 Thessalonians 4:3);
* to rejoice, pray fervently, and to be thankful (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18); and
* to do good to bring silence to evil (1 Peter 2:15).

### What About the Judgment? 
If faith alone were true, how is it that we're not judged by our faith alone? We're judged by what we've said (Matthew 12:36-37) and what we've done (Matthew 25:31-46, John 5:28-29, Romans 2:6-11, Revelation 20:12-15, 1 Peter 1:17, 2 Corinthians 5:10, Matthew 7:21-23, Galatians 6:7-9, and Romans 14:10-12). Wouldn't it logically follow that good works play a role in our ultimate salvation? Read those passages again. Are they not speaking salvifically? It's faith alone only if we understand what type of faith we are to have. 

But, like the apostle James says, "*faith without works is dead* (James 2:14-26)." This should stir something within us to want to love and do good works (Hebrews 10:24-25) and "*conduct our stay here in fear* (1 Peter 1:17)." And what sense does this make for us to be fearful if it's a judgment that only enforces rewards to be lost as the Free Gracer teaches?

Imagine you're in a boxing match and fighting for the title. Along with the championship belt comes sponsorships to prominent sporting organizations, clothing lines, and TV advertising. What if you win the fight, but soon after, you conduct yourself in a belligerent and unsatisfactory manner, causing you to lose those sponsorships and other rewards? Would you feel fear? Or would you feel shame and embarrassment; maybe self-loathing, pity, or guilt? In other words, there is a major difference between an *aversion* to losing a reward or the *fear* of losing a reward--people don't fear losing a reward.

#### Is the Judgment Just Suffering Loss?
"*Ah but read 1 Corinthians 3:12-15! We suffer loss at the Judgment but will still be saved*," the Free Gracer says. It wasn't until I questioned this passage with my feeble understanding of it--as I used to hold to the same view as what was just espoused--until I realized what was actually being taught. 

So, what does Paul mean in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 then? In short, it's the rewards given to the planters and waterers (1 Corinthians 3:5-7). Not every individual believer is in question in this passage. And the key to understanding this is in verse 8: "*Now **he who plants** and **he who waters** are one, and **each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor**.* (1 Corinthians 3:8, emphasis added)" And this is why directly after that verse, Paul calls the Corinthians--the individual believers--God's field, God's building (1 Corinthians 3:9). Later in his discourse, Paul is not pointing back to the building, but the laborer who "*will be saved, yet so as through fire* (1 Corinthians 3:15)". He culminates this thought by stating they are God's temple and if they defile their temple, God will destroy them (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). Does this make any rational sense in light of what was just said by Paul? Does being destroyed by God sound like "*he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire*?" By using the entire context of the passage, it clearly refers to faithful planters and waterers losing rewards for the foundations which they built upon in other's lives. The believers who defiled their temple are destroyed, but who built upon their temple will be saved--they'll just suffer the loss from what that believer chose to do with their own temple.

It's like a landlord who owns several buildings in a neighborhood. It's not the fault of the landlord if a tenant sets fire to their own home. Though the landlord will ultimately suffer loss of that building, they themself will be spared from the destruction of the fire which consumed the house and of the tenant who perished along with it.

## Eternal Security
When I personally held to the view of eternal security--or Once Saved Always Saved (OSAS) as it's often referred to as--I admit that I was never fully persuaded or convinced of it. And the main reason was 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. However, there were many other passages to include:

* Ephesians 5:3-5
* Galatians 5:19-21
* Revelation 21:8
* Hebrews 6:4-6
* Hebrews 10:26-31
* 1 John 3:6-10
* Matthew 7:21-23

I never could reconcile the fact that "*Christians can live any way they want*," as many in the Free Grace camp suppose, with the passages which state, "*those who do such things will **not** inherit the kingdom of heaven*." Not all Free Gracers come out and say this, though. While some do, most Free Gracers do admit that believers who "*do such things*" will simply suffer judgment here on earth and/or the loss of rewards at the final judgment. 

For me, the most compelling passage against that assertion and one that utterly rejects eternal security and OSAS is that of 1 Corinthians 9:24-10:12. In this passage, we see Paul *himself* saying that he can be disqualified (1 Corinthians 9:27). The Greek word for "disqualified" used in that passage is á¼€Î´á½¹ÎºÎ¹Î¼Î¿Ï‚ [(adokimos)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g96/nkjv/tr/0-1/) and is translated 8 other times in the New Testament as reprobate (6), castaway (1), and rejected (1). Why would the apostle Paul who suffered beatings, shipwrecks, imprisonments, and constant tribulations for the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 11:23-28) think he could become disqualified if eternal security is true? More than this, does "disqualified", "reprobate", "castaway", or "rejected" seem like words that suggest a loss of rewards or a loss of salvation?

If that wasn't enough, let's continue Paul's thought from "adokimos". After saying he could be disqualified, he then speaks of the Israelites (1 Corinthians 10:1-5) and how they serve as an example to us today (1 Corinthians 10:6) to not fall into the same sinful behavior (1 Corinthians 10:7-10). Why? Because this behavior caused their destruction (1 Corinthians 10:10) and their destruction was written for our admonition that we *don't* follow the same path as they did (1 Corinthians 10:11). Therefore, we must never be complacent in thinking we cannot fall--as eternal security and OSAS so falsely claim--but must take heed (1 Corinthians 10:12). We need to follow the full course of Paul's thought to gain an insight to the point he was trying to make.

But what did the early Christians believe about OSAS?

> "Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called, we fall asleep in our sins. For then, the wicked prince, acquiring power over us, will thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord." -- Barnabas (c. 80-120 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I p. 139

> "Rather, we should fear ourselves, least perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but are shut out from His kingdom." -- Irenaeus (120-200 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I p. 499

> "The world returned to sin...and so it is destined for fire. So is the man who after baptism renews his sins." -- Tertullian (160-240 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume III p. 673

> "A man may possess an acquired righteousness, from which it is possible for him to fall away." -- Origen (185-253 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume IV p. 266


## Lack of Repentance
Proponents of Free Grace, and *especially* those holding to Hyper-Grace<sup>[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Grace_theology)</sup>, have an almost abhorrent disdain for repentance. They claim that repentance is not necessary for salvation, yet our Lord is the One who said we will perish if we don't repent (Luke 13:3,5). The apostles understood this and taught repentance as well. Peter told us to repent and be baptized for the remission of sins (Acts 2:38); Paul told the men of Athens that all men everywhere are commanded to repent (Acts 17:30) and he even told King Agrippa that all should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance (Acts 26:20). Similarly, the Forerunner of our Lord Jesus, John the Baptist, told all those who were listening that they needed to repent (Luke 3:3) and that true repentance bears fruit (Luke 3:8). He even mentioned what true repentance looks like (Luke 3:10-14).

Sadly, most Free Gracers will vehemently deny the fact that repentance is anything other than a change of mind--and they're right... to an extent. They are right in the sense that the Greek word Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î½Î¿á½³Ï‰ [(metanoia)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3340/nkjv/tr/0-1/]"), used to translate "repent," does in fact mean to change one's mind. However, they're wrong that actions don't follow a change of mind. Scriptures already were provided to prove this, however, let's think about it logically. If I am craving a burger, I change my mind and now want a pizza instead, but if I still eat the burger did I change my mind?

We've appealed to our Lord's own words, His apostlesâ€™ words, simple logic, and now let's see what the early church had to say about true repentance:

> "He who has sinned [after being forgiven] should fear, even though he may obtain pardon because of his repentance, for he is as one no longer washed to the forgiveness of sins...the frequent asking of forgiveness, then, for those things in which we often transgress is only the imitation of repentance." -- Clement of Alexandria (150-215 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume II p. 361

> "God especially desires for men to be cleansed from their sins. Therefore, He commands them to repent. Yet, to repent is nothing else than to profess and to affirm that one will sin no more." -- Lactantius (240-320 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume VII p. 178

> "But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man's salvation. -- Tertullian (160-240 AD), [On Repentance](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian20.html) 

### Antinomianism
An unfortunate consequence of Free Grace theology is it leads to [antinomianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomianism). Given their loyal stance on "faith alone," this should be no surprise. If it's "faith alone," then what's the need to be obedient under your King, if in fact He is your King? 

The verse they tend to use to support their view is Romans 6:14. "*We are not under law*," correct. But we are not under the *Mosaic Law*. Paul was not saying that we are to live lawless lives. This is completely contradictory to some of his other teachings (Ephesians 5:3-5, Galatians 5:19-21, and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 to name a few). But it doesn't matter as much as what the apostle Paul said so much as it does what the Lord Jesus Christ said. Remember Matthew 7:21-23? Verse 23 where our Lord says, "*depart from Me, you who practice **lawlessness**,*" is the key. It's the Greek word á¼€Î½Î¿Î¼á½·Î± [(anomia)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g458/nkjv/tr/0-1/]"). Sounds a lot like "antinomianism," right?

Let's go a bit further. In 1 John 3:4, we have a definition of sin. Can you guess what it is? None other than the exact same Greek word "anomia." If we've been saved from our sin (Matthew 1:21) and the reason Christ came was to destroy works of the devil (1 John 3:8)--sin being a work of the devil--then how can we expect to live in sin if sin is what the Lamb of God came to take away (John 1:29)? And how can we expect to be anything but a child of the devil if we're living in and knowingly practicing sin (1 John 3:10)?

Let's wrap up with some quotes from the early Christians regarding this:

> "It is for this reason that [the Gnostics] neither regard works as necessary for themselves, nor do they observe any of the calls of duty." -- Tertullian (160-240 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume III p. 517

> "Some of the [Gnostics]...simply deny the Law and Prophets for the sake of their lawless impious doctrine. And under the pretense of grace, they have sunk down to the lowest abyss of perdition." -- Eusebius (260-339 AD), quoting Caius (died 296 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume V p. 602

> "[The Gnostics] keep silent with regards to His judgments and all those things which will come upon those who have heard His words, but have not done them. For it would be better for them if they had not been born." -- Irenaeus (120-200 AD), Ante-Nicene Fathers Volume I p. 501

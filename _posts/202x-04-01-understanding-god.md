## Intro
If God is God, can we really know Him? After all, wouldn't the Creator of the universe be too much for our minds to comprehend? Certain aspects, sure, but the Bible does say that *God is love*, which is the first hint we should take to heart if we're to better understand Him. His Word also says that whoever loves, knows God [(1<sup>st</sup> John 4:7)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7&version=ESV) and whoever loves God is known by God [(1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 8:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208%3A3&version=ESV). Those are very powerful Scriptures which give us but a glimpse into God's character. But I think we can use the key to all of those passages--which is `love`--to understand God even more. This is vitally important for our Christian walk as this will not only increase our love for God, but will aid us in showing more love to others as well.

## God Is Love
> <u>1<sup>st</sup> John 4:8</u> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

The second part of the above verse is what I want to spend time focusing on, *God is love*. This is crucial because it's the first piece of the puzzle to better understanding God. A natural question to this statement might be, "*if God is love, what exactly is love?*" In other words, what are some qualities of love and how can we know what love looks like? It's a question I've posed to myself many times. But here's the beauty of the Bible. You can read a passage 1,000 times and gloss over other parts of the Bible that might be better equipped at explaining your question for you. And it's there where God reveals the dynamic nature of His Word! 

### If God Is Love...
This leads me to [1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8&version=ESV). A very common passage that you've likely heard a dozen times depending on how many weddings you've attended.

> <u>1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 13:4-8</u>:<br>
> **4** Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant<br>
> **5** or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;<br>
> **6** it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.<br>
> **7** Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>
> **8** Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.

So this begs the question, *can we just replace `love` with `God` in the verses above?* I think so, and we can come to a reasonable conclusion of this if we examine each sub-point with Scripture.

**God is patient and kind** We see this in passages such as [2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203%3A9&version=NKJV), [Nehemiah 9:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+9%3A17&version=NKJV), [Psalm 36:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+36%3A7&version=NKJV), and [Psalm 63:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+63%3A3&version=NKJV).<br>
**God does not envy or boast; God is not arrogant or rude** Since there aren't really verses speaking on this as it relates to God, we can use Jesus as our example. And what better example for Jesus said, "*I and my Father are one." [(John 10:30)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A30&version=NKJV) Therefore, we see Jesus as a humble servant ([Matthew 20:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020%3A28&version=ESV) & [Philippians 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A8&version=NKJV)) which is very often used to describe His character and is one quality that we cannot see boasting or arrogance in.<br>
**God does not insist on His own way; God is not irritable or resentful** We are given free will to choose to walk in the light or in darkness [(1<sup>st</sup> John 1:6-7)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A6-7&version=KJV). God is not irritable since He is slow to anger [(Psalm 103:3)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A8&version=KJV). Typically, `love` is seen as an antonym to resent and we can conclude that since God is love, God is not resentful.<br>
**God does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth** God *hates* sin ([Proverbs 6:16-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%206%3A16-19&version=NKJV), [Psalm 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%205%3A5&version=NKJV)), but rejoices when even just *one* sinner comes to repentance [(Luke 15:7)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15%3A7&version=NKJV).<br>
**God bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things; God never ends** We can safely assume God bears all things since He's the Creator of all things; likewise, He believes all things because He knows His creation and what He created. And since God is love, love has been here before the world began and much before we ever stepped foot onto it ([2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+peter+3%3A8&version=KJV), [Psalm 90:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+90%3A2&version=KJV), and [Psalm 90:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+90%3A4&version=KJV)).<br>

## Conclusion
God is love. That powerful verse in 1<sup>st</sup> John 4:8 helps us by unlocking our mind to who God really is. From those three words alone, we can draw many comparisons to the nature and character of God. The famous passage in 1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 13, often called the *Love Passage*, is one such comparison. Paul uses `love` in many different contexts and shows us a better understanding of love in that passage of Scripture. And since "*God is love*," then we can assume a mere replacement of `love` with `God` in that passage can suffice for a starting level of understanding of who God really is. In addition to this, we looked at love in a different context--a loving father--and showed how God not only fits this description, but far exceeds it. I hope that after reading this post, you have a renewed sense of how to love God and love others by better understanding just one word: love.

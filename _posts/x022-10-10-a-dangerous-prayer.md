# Intro
On my way home from the grocery store just this morning, I heard a very concerning description of how to be saved from Greg Laurie, Senior Pastor of [Harvest Ministries](https://harvest.org/). At the end of his message, he stated something to the effect of, "If you want to be saved, pray this prayer after me: *Dear Lord, I am a sinner. I turn from my sins right now and turn to You. I believe in You as my Lord and Savior. Thank You for saving me. Amen*." But, just how effective is this for saving one's soul? Since I don't believe in click-bait blog posts, or posts that you must read lengthy walls of text just to find your answer, let me be clear: this is **not** going to save you. This is an absurdly heretical teaching that should be done away with.

This method of "salvation", if you want to call it that, is often coined as `Easy-Prayerism` or the `Sinner's Prayer`. What Greg Laurie didn't mention here, `Ask Jesus Into Your Heart`, is something of another method, albeit similar in nature, that a lot of other evangelicals teach today--and subsequently was founded around the same time (which we'll get into a little later). `Ask Jesus Into Your Heart` goes hand-in-hand with `Easy-Prayerism` and the `Sinner's Prayer`; they are three peas in a pod so to speak; therefore we'll lump these heretical teachings together as we get into the discussion. As always, we'll examine this in light of Scripture as we should always strive to do. Let us then ask ourselves, [what saith the scripture?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+4%3A3&version=KJV).

## Why Is It Dangerous?
**Lacking Acknowledgement of Sin**<br>
For starters, there is no leading the sinner to acknowledge their sinful behavior. Jesus said in [Matthew 9:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A12&version=KJV), "*they that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick*." If a person doesn't think they're sick, or worse, if they're in denial that they're sick, they will never go to the doctor. Just the same, a lost sinner won't recognize their need for a savior unless they become guilty before God as [Romans 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&version=KJV) states. How can *anyone* become "guilty before God" and recognize their sin in a mere prayer such as that? They can’t; there's no Scripture to back it up. Just having someone repeat "I'm a sinner" does nothing to show them why they are a sinner or how they are a sinner. Rather, they need to know that [all have sinned](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=KJV), including them. A sinner needs to know there is a [penalty for sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=KJV) and if they're not found in the Book of Life, they will be [cast into the lake of of fire](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20%3A14-15&version=KJV) forever. 

**Lacking Repentance**<br>
The Bible says in [Mark 1:15]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201%3A15&version=KJV) to “*repent and believe the gospel*.” In order to believe the Gospel, one must first show repentance--or a change of mind. If you don’t change your mind about your position with God, i.e., recognizing you’re a sinner, you will certainly never truly believe and subsequently, never be saved. This points back to the analogy of *they that be whole need not a physician*. You **must** first recognize your need for a Savior! You cannot do that through only repeating a prayer after some Pastor. How can you change your mind if they never told you anything? 

**Lacking the True Object of Faith**<br>
Imagine having a conversation with an unbeliever and during the conversation, whether organically or inorganically, you ask the question: "*If you were to die right now, would you go to heaven?*" We'll assume they say, "no" or "I don't know". Now let's use the tactic that Greg Laurie and thousands of other evangelicals use and have used for decades. You lead them in the `Sinner's Prayer`. Years later, they are having a conversation with another evangelical using the very same tactic. However, this time they say, "Yes! I prayed the prayer years ago!" This is anecdotal, but I have heard this countless times.

You see, the problem here is that the object of faith becomes the prayer itself. This is not the Gospel. In the book of Hebrews, the author tells us to [look unto]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+12%3A2&version=KJV)) Jesus. The very first word used in that passage is “look”. Just about everyone knows John 3:16. I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of atheists today could quote that verse. But what’s beautiful about John 3:16 is the context—just two verses prior. In John 3:14, Jesus states:

> <u>John 3:14</u>: And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up

This is a direct reference to a story in Numbers 21:4-9. The story goes:

> <u>Numbers 21:4-9</u>:<br>
**4** And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.<br>
**5** And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. <br>
**6** And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. <br>
**7** Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. <br>
**8** And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. <br>
**9** And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

The real point of this, and why I mentioned the word "look", is found in verse 9. If anyone simply `beheld` or, another way of putting it: “looked at” the serpent, they lived and were healed. Why did Jesus pick this passage? Because we are to do the very same thing today. Look to Jesus and live! Jesus is the object of our faith, not some man-made prayer. 

**Lacking The Gospel**<br>
Lastly and certainly most important, a sinner needs to know the [Gospel]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A1-4&version=KJV), the good news, that Jesus died for us while we were [yet sinners]( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A8&version=KJV). 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 teaches us very plainly the Gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Paul says to the Corinthian believers at the Church of Corinth that the Gospel is two things:

1. *wherein ye stand*
2. *by which also ye are saved*

Assuming this is true, how do you explain just simply praying a prayer is on-par with the Gospel? Do we stand in our prayer? Are we saved by our prayer? Certainly not. We are saved by God’s grace through faith and faith alone in Jesus Christ.

## A Brief History Lesson
Dr. Paul Chitwood, in his [theological dissertation](http://digital.library.sbts.edu/bitstream/handle/10392/4153/Chitwood-PhD-SinnersPrayer.pdf?sequence=1) from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary found that the `Sinner's Prayer` didn't appear well into the 20th Century--not until around 1945 in fact. It wasn't until several years later that this evangelistic method started to become more mainstream and popularized by none other than Billy Graham. Interestingly, Dr. Paul Chitwood also found in his research that no gospel tracts, which often are reliable indicators of evangelistic tactics of years past, did not include *any* mention of prayer until, as mentioned already, the 1940s. You must ask yourself: "*If the Sinner's Prayer is something we should use a tactic for salvation or evangelism, why were no evidences of this prayer found until the 20th Century?*"

## What About Romans 10:9-13?
**Verse 9 -- Confess**<br>
Since most evangelicals that follow this tactic of salvation defend their position by quoting Romans 10:9-13, let's take some time to analyze this passage of Scripture. They'll read [Romans 10:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9&version=KJV) and say “See! `Confess` means to pray!” Makes sense, right? But the Greek word used for `confess` in that passage is "[homologeo](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3670/kjv/tr/0-1/)" which can be broken down into two words it was rooted from: `homo` and `logos`. `Homo` meaning "the same" and `logos` meaning "word". Piecing it together, we have "same word" where we ultimately get "homologeo" to translate: "to say the same thing as..." Confessing Jesus means we are to be in agreement with Him; who He said He was and believe what He did on the Cross. At the end of the day, [can two walk together unless they be agreed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=amos+3%3A3&version=KJV)?

**Verse 13 -- Call**<br>
The next thing they may bring up is the word `call` found in verse 13. Let's look at the Greek again. The Greek word "[epikaleō](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g1941/kjv/tr/0-1/)" actually sounds good here because we get translations such as:

* to cry out upon or against one
* invoke
* to call upon for one's self, in one's behalf

Welp, here's where the post ends. Pack it up boys and girls. In all seriousness, this can certainly mean to pray. However, the most vital thing is missing in this verse and is the reason why "text without context is pretext." The very next verse, Romans 10:14 says:

> <u>Romans 10:14:</u>  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

We cannot “call” or pray if we haven’t believed in Him first. We can’t believe in Him if we never heard the Gospel. We can’t hear the Gospel if we are presented with it. 
 
## The Tax Collector and the Publican
> <u>Luke 18:9-14:</u><br>
> **9** And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:<br>
**10** Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.<br>
**11** The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. <br>
**12** I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. <br>
**13** And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. <br>
**14** I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

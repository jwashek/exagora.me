## Intro
Many Christians today don't have the assurance of salvation. This is an all-too-common struggle that a lot, if not all, Christians experience at one point or another in their walk with the Lord. But, what does the Bible say about assurance? Can we even *have* assurance in this lifetime? In actuality, the Bible has **a lot** to say on this topic and you can rest easy knowing the facts. So next time you struggle with assurance, examine yourself with the Word of God and rest knowing the Lord Jesus' work was **finished** on the Cross at Calvary. But for now, let's dig a little deeper and equip ourselves to better address this problem we all mostly likely face.

## Necessary Sacrifice
### Out with the Old

### In with the New

## Facts Over Feelings
Nailed to the cross verse
ephesians 1:13-14

## Just-If-I'd

## Redemption

## A Needless Checklist
I say "needless" because we shouldn't need one to begin with. But if anyone is like me, it's nice to have points you can drill down into.
Let's look at 1 John
Let's look at Gifts of the Spirit
Let's look at
Examine yourselves. Restore unto me the joy of my salvation (pretty sure this was AFTER David sinned with Bathsheba). Sin can take us out of assurance.

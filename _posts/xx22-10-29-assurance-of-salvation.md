## Intro
Many Christians today don't have the assurance of salvation. This is an all-too-common struggle that a lot, if not all, Christians experience at one point or another in their walk with the Lord. The reasons can range from sin to a lack of trust in God, but the lack of assurance doesn't have to last, right? What does the Bible say about assurance? Actually, the Bible has **a lot** to say on this topic and you can rest easy knowing the facts. So next time you struggle with assurance, examine yourself with the Word of God [[2 Corinthians 13:5]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=KJV) and rest knowing the Lord Jesus' work was **finished** on the Cross at Calvary. But for now, let's dig a little deeper and equip ourselves to better address this problem we all mostly likely face or have faced.

## Why Do We Lose Assurance?
### Sin
Maybe not surprisingly, the first reason we lose assurance as believers is sin. Sin in the sense of actual sin in our lives or even in the sense of us posing questions to ourselves like, "*would a **real** Christian struggle with this?*" We tend to invalidate our position with God because of the sin in our lives. Possibly because we forgot our sins were forgiven? Don't turn your back on conviction when you feel it enter your life. Take the disciple and chastisement [[Hebrews 12:8]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012%3A8&version=KJV) in stride. Apply what God is instructing you and learn from it. This conviction isn't all that bad, though, because conviction is something used by the Holy Spirit to draw us nearer to God. Use the conviction to your advantage and pray that God will show you any sins you need to deal with to restore your fellowship with Him. Overcome your sin and regain your assurance by trusting in the Lord!

### Trusting Ourselves
Trusting in ourselves and our own self-righteousness (i.e., good works) will cause us to doubt our salvation possibly quicker than sin does--and for good reason. Think about it... how many good works should we do? What if we missed an opportunity to do something good? If we sin, do we need to counter that with two good works? Remember, Isaiah said *all our righteousness is as filthy rags* [[Isaiah 64:6]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2064%3A6&version=KJV). **Nothing** you do can put you in good standing with God except your faith in Jesus Christ. There is a phenomenal book written by Andrew Murray called [*Abide In Christ*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Abide_in_Christ/KvgaAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) that I read very recently. In one of the chapters it was stated that, since we are saved by faith and faith alone, why do we reason with ourselves that we also aren't sanctified through faith? Trusting, resting, and relying solely on Jesus Christ in **all** aspects of our Christian walk is what we should strive to acheive--and that not of ourselves. Trust in the Lord in all things [[Proverbs 3:5-6]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203%3A5-6&version=KJV)! Paul summed it up rather well with a question in his epistle to the Church at Galatia:

> <u>Galatians 3:2</u> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

We received the Holy Spirit not by anything *we* did, have done, or will do, but only through faith and our trust in Jesus Christ. Let's put off our efforts and put on His effort. Overcome your self-righteousness and regain your assurance by trusting in His righteousness!

### Spiritual Stagnation
You may have heard the saying, "*if you're not progressing, you're regressing*." It seems Peter taught this very thing in regards to our faith. In his 2nd letter, Peter states: 

> <u>2 Peter 1:5-9:</u><br>
> **5** And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br>
> **6** And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br>
> **7** And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br>
> **8** For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
> **9** But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

If we are not growing in the Lord, Peter says we can become barren and unfruitful, we can become blind, and we can even forget Christ has **purged** our sins from us. All of this certainly leading to doubting our salvation or having a lack of assurance. Overcome the spiritual stagnation and regain your assurance by growing your faith in Jesus Christ!

## Blood Sacrifice
I thought it necessary to briefly explain how sacrifices worked in the Old Testament and how this differed from the New Testament. This will be an important lead-in to the next major section. Having a high-level understanding of how sacrifices worked will only make us appreciate the next section even more... so why not, right? 

### Out with the Old
The holy of holies (or Most Holy Place) was the inner sanctuary within the [Tabernacle](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/what-does-the-tabernacle-symbolize/), which was essentially a tented palace where the high priest would offer sacrifices to God. Inside the Tabernacle, and just before the Most Holy Place, there was a separation by a large veil. Behind this veil--and within the Most Holy Place itself--is where the ark of the covenant resided. Within the ark was the mercy seat (hopefully you're still with me). Now, each year during the [Day of Atonement](https://www.gotquestions.org/Day-Atonement-Yom-Kippur.html), the high priest had to enter into the Most Holy Place and sprinkle the blood of sacrificed bulls and goats upon the mercy seat to atone for the sins of the high priest as well as for the children of Israel.

> <u>Leviticus 16:14-16</u><br>
> **14** And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.<br>
> **15** Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:<br>
> **16** And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

### In with the New
Alright, we now understand how sin was atoned for (a possibly better word to use is `covered`, and this will be important later on) in the Old Testament, let's see how it was done in the New Testament.nThough, a blood sacrifice was still required, it was by *His own blood* [[Hebrews 9:12]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209%3A12&version=KJV). `His` obviously referring to the Lord Jesus Christ. 

### An Analogy to Better Understand

## Facts Over Feelings

## Just-If-I'd


## A Needless Checklist
I say "needless" because we shouldn't need one to begin with. But if anyone is like me, it's nice to have points you can drill down into.
Let's look at 1 John
Let's look at Gifts of the Spirit
Let's look at
Examine yourselves. Restore unto me the joy of my salvation (pretty sure this was AFTER David sinned with Bathsheba). Sin can take us out of assurance.

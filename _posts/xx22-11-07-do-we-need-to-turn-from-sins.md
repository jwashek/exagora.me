title: "Turning From Sin"
excerpt: "Do we need to turn from sin in order to be saved? This is what a lot of preachers teach today, but there is zero support from Scripture to back up this claim--as we'll examine here."

## Intro
I recently wrote an article about the dangerous doctrine of the [Sinner's Pray](https://www.exagora.me/heresy/a-dangerous-prayer/). What inspired me to write that article was partly the same inspiration for this post. Greg Laurie--in the prayer that he claims we need to pray in order to be saved--said, "*...I turn from my sins right now and turn to You...*." Sadly, he's not the only preacher teaching this nonsense. There are countless others such as Ray Comfort and John MacArthur, just to name a few. Now, there are differences in *when* preachers teach you need to turn (i.e., as a requirement for salvation or as a requirement after salvation), so our main focus will be, "*do I need to turn from sin in order to **be** saved?*" Though I do believe turning from sin in order to maintain salvation can be argued against in the very same manner, I wanted the main focus of this post to surround the idea of turning from sin **before** we get saved; a prerequisite of sorts. We will look this school of thought and point out the errors by using Scripture as well as basic logic supported by Scripture. 

### Quick Disclaimer:
I, in no way, am attempting to pick on other teachers here. However, as [Romans 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+16%3A17&version=KJV) mentions, we are to "*mark and avoid*" those that cause divisions contrary to the doctrine which we have received. Additionally, [Galatians 1:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+1%3A8-9&version=KJV) clearly teaches that anything other than what Paul preached pertaining to the gospel, is a false gospel. Turning from sin is never once mentioned in [the Gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A1-4&version=KJV) and we can conclude "turning from sin" is a false gospel and anyone preaching it is a false teacher.

## Turning From Sin
### Requirement *For* Salvation?
Ray Comfort errantly teaches we must turn from sin to become saved. In the below video from [3:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAEcmkjL4w&t=187s) to [3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAEcmkjL4w&t=195s), Ray describes that "*repentance is an old-fashioned word that means to confess and forsake your sins.*"

Ironically, Ray and his team flip-flop their stance on their Living Waters podcast about [*What Is Repentance?*](https://livingwaters.com/what-is-repentance) at the 5:24 mark. If you listen at that point, it was mentioned that repentance is "a change of mind", to which the Bible would agree. But if you continue to listen from that moment, they complain that people confuse what they mean on repentance... well, can you blame them? What is it? Is repentance a "change of mind" or is it "confessing and forsaking your sins?" Because, those are wildly different responses to the same question. The reason why so many confuse their stance on repentance is because Ray Comfort himself is confused. He teaches that you must turn from sin, then he agrees that it's a change of mind. 

If that wasn't enough, listen to Ray's very [disturbing answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu3-Eku79h0&t=220s) on how we become saved:

1. "There are two things you have to do to be saved. First, you must repent... turn from all sin and live in holiness... 
2. and trust alone in Jesus."

Let me ask you this, do you see what he did there? He placed our trust (i.e., faith, belief) in Jesus only **after** we turn from all of our sin. Why is that an afterthought? We trust in ourselves first to rid ourselves of sin (which is impossible as [1 John 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A8&version=KJV) says, by the way), then and only then do we have faith in Jesus? What about "*come, whosoever will*"[(Revelation 22:17)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A17&version=KJV)? What about [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=KJV)? [Acts 16:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016%3A31&version=KJV)? [Acts 10:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010%3A43&version=KJV)? If you are trusting in this method to get saved, let me be clear: you will die in your sins attempting to save yourself before you ever trust in Jesus for salvation. 

**What Does the Bible Say?**<br>
The Bible uses the word Greek word ["metanoia"](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g3341/kjv/tr/0-1/) for repentance, which simply means, "a change of mind." You're changing your mind in what you're trusting in. You repent **towards** God, like [Acts 20:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020%3A21&version=KJV) mentions, and have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, let's just replace the word `repent` in that verse with both Ray Comfort's description of repentance and the Bible's description of repentance.

| Ray's Teaching  | The Bible's Teaching  |
|---|---|
| "Turning from all your sin and living in holiness" towards God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ  | "a change of mind" towards God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ  |

You see the difference? This is a false works-based gospel, which will be proved in the next section.


## A Further Examination
### What is Sin? 
Sin is transgression of the Law.

### Logical Errors
**Keeping the Law**<br>
as seen above, if sin is transgression of the Law, wouldn't turning from sin mean that you're keeping the law?

Acts 15

**Just How Many Sins?**<br>

**Drowning In the Ocean**<br>

**Was Paul Unsaved?**<br>

title: "Turning From Sin"
excerpt: "Do we need to turn from sin in order to be saved? This is what a lot of preachers teach today, but there is zero support from Scripture to back up this claim--as we'll examine here."

## Intro
I recently wrote an article about the dangerous doctrine of the [Sinner's Pray](https://www.exagora.me/heresy/a-dangerous-prayer/). What inspired me to write that article was partly the same inspiration for this post. Greg Laurie--in the prayer he claims we need to pray in order to be saved--said, "*...I turn from my sins right now and turn to you...*." Sadly, he's not the only preacher teaching this nonsense. There are countless others such as Ray Comfort and John MacArthur, just to name a few. Now, there are differences in *when* preachers teach you need to turn (i.e., as a requirement for salvation or as a requirement after salvation), so our main focus will be, "*do I need to turn from sin in order to **be** saved?*" Though I do believe turning from sin in order to maintain salvation can be argued against in the very same manner, I wanted the main focus of this post to surround the idea of turning from sin **before** we get saved. However, we will look into both schools of thought and point out the errors by using Scripture and basic logic supported by Scripture. 

## Turning From Sin
### Requirement *For* Salvation?
Ray Comfort errantly teaches we must turn from sin to become saved. Here's the brief video.

### Requirement *After* Salvation?
Another way to word this section's heading would be to turn from sin as a sort of maintenance for salvation. 

### Why Is This Taught?
Confusion About Repentance

### Isn't It A Good Thing?
While I agree the act of turning from sin is a good thing, I don't agree that it is a good thing when considering it as a requirement for salvation itself.

**Comparison to Others**<br>
Another reason this may be taught is indirectly for us to compare ourselves to other believers. people can boast and be like the Pharisee who said "I am glad I'm not like this person... I do all these things"

**A Sense of Achievement**<br>

**Pride**<br>

## A Further Examination
### What is Sin? 
Sin is transgression of the Law.

### Logical Errors
**Keeping the Law**<br>
as seen above, if sin is transgression of the Law, wouldn't turning from sin mean that you're keeping the law?

**Just How Many Sins?**<br>
If 

**Drowning In the Ocean**<br>

### Acts 15

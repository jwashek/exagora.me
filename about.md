## Quick Intro
This blog is not about me, I just want to magnify and glorify God for what He has done in my life. But sometimes, the best way to do that is to get personal and tell your own story. That's what this page is all about. This is my story of how God saved me through my faith in Jesus Christ. 

## My Testimony
**The Early Days**<br>
Back when I was in Middle School, I was a very bad kid. Maybe like most kids you might think? Well, most kids don't do drugs before they're a teenager. Most kids don't get kicked out of school for getting in trouble too much. I wasn't most kids.

**Beginning Thoughts on God**<br>
I grew up Catholic and having knowledge about God. I hadn't really given it too much thought if I'm being honest. I knew about heaven and hell but didn't care. I wasn't a murderer or any of the other obviously evil things out there, so I was safe... in my own eyes at least. My dad was different; he was a Christian and always telling me about Christ. *Jesus died for you*, *you can't earn your way into heaven*, and *you need to repent and believe in Him* were all very common things I heard as a pre-teen and teenager. "Yeah, okay, dad. Thanks for the Bible you bought me years ago that just collects dust on my shelf now!"

> __Note:__ This will be important later in my testimony

I brushed it off and never gave much thought to it because:

* I was a good person
* I believed in God
* I kept (some) of the 10 Commandments
* I prayed sometimes
* I confessed certain sins to a priest
* I was baptized as a baby

The list goes on. Did you notice the common theme there? That short, little one-letter word of `I`. *I do this*, *I do that*; *I don't do this*, *I don't do that*. It's what most religion requires--a self-righteous effort on behalf of the individual. We rely on ourselves and our own personal effort to save us. Newsflash: we're all human. We **will** make mistakes--and plenty of them. We will fail. It's in our nature. This reason alone is why we cannot rely on ourselves and we must rely on Someone else. That "Someone" being the Lord Jesus Christ.

**The Day I'll Never Forget**<br>
If you remember earlier on, I mentioned getting kicked out of school. That is really where the story begins. After countless detentions, In-School Suspensions, and Out-of-School Suspensions, the School Board decided to kick me out and have me continue the remainder of the year in AEP (Alternative Education Program). AEP was essentially a tiny building next to the school where all the other kids that got kicked out went to finish up the rest of the school year. This was around Springtime of 2006.

One day, I remember finishing up my schoolwork early and having nothing to do. I looked around the room and noticed one thing in common about each person there. They were bad. Some were *very* bad. I remember thinking this and then having a moment of introspection: *am I bad too?* It was at this moment that I had deep conviction about my past and present state.

Sometime later, I'm not sure if it was the same day, days later, weeks later--I don't know--I went home and started playing a video game on my PlayStation 2. Out of seemingly nowhere, I got up, turned off my PlayStation 2, picked up the Bible off my shelf that my Dad bought me years ago, blew the dust off, and started reading from Genesis 1:1. I got around halfway through the page before I had another moment of introspection: *what am I doing?!* However, the difference this time didn't bring conviction like before, but an immense joy and intense chills in my whole body. Now, I don't believe we are saved by feelings, whether physical or in our mind, but I know what I felt and that feeling was unlike any other I had experienced before.

I called my dad right away and told him what happened. He prayed with me on the phone and from that day forward, I believed. I **truly** believed. It was a different type of belief; it was not mere head knowledge, but it was literally life-changing and altered my thinking and lifestyle from that day forward. I was saved! (I still *am* saved!)

**The Aftermath**<br>
Immediately after I got saved, I remember having no desire for drugs, alcohol, or living the godless and sinful life I used to live. I quit swearing, I quit watching porn; I had a massive change all around. Many family members and friends witnessed this new change and mentioned it to me quite often. This made me happy because I knew I was a "new creature" as 2 Corinthians 5:17 states. Now, all of this is well and good, but let me be clear: turning from sin and having a changed life is **not** what saves us. Turning to Jesus is. Believing in the [Gospel](https://jwashek.github.io/salvation/gospel/what-is-the-gospel/) and trusting Jesus to save you; relying solely upon Him is the only thing that can save us. It is our faith through God's grace how we are saved (Ephesians 2:8-9). 

Turning from sin is part of sanctification, or "being set apart". It is a lifelong experience--separate from salvation--and is often confused by many preachers today. It is very important to the Christian, but one thing is for certain: even with the process of sanctification, Christians will stumble, miss the mark, and sin. But when we do sin as believers, we have an advocate (1 John 2:1)! Sin is in our nature. I do. You do. We all do. But when you're saved and have the Spirit living in you, why would you want to continue living the way you lived before you were saved? Galatians 2:20 is one of my favorite verses and I think it's a good summation of why we should want to live for Christ after being saved. It states:

> <u>Galatians 2:20</u>: I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
  
Christ gave His life for us. We should want to live our lives for Him as a result of this unspeakable love He showed to us in dying a horrible, painful death on the Cross. This was the aftermath of my salvation. I wanted to read the Bible, be obedient to Him, listen to sermons, spend more time praying, and telling others about Christ. Was I perfect in that? Absolutely not. I will be the first to admit it. However, I did have a desire to know Him and I wanted to live my life trying to please Him and be obedient to Him. 

**Present Day**<br>
All those years ago, I still haven't lost my faith in Jesus, my Savior. But in those years between first getting saved and now, I certainly had my fair share of mishaps in sin, doing things I knew I shouldn't (Romans 7:18-19), and not devoting nearly as much time reading/studying the Bible that I should have. Just within the past several months (Summer 2022) is when I have deepened my relationship with Jesus to a level of when I first got saved back in Spring of 2006. And boy is it refreshing! Like I said before, I never lost my faith, but I did lose my zeal over the years. It's something I am striving to claim back. 

Even after all those years though, I still get convicted over sin and I honestly thank God for that. It is that conviction that drew me closer to Him then and draws me closer to Him now. It *was* that conviction that led me here right now. I wanted for so long to write a blog and dedicate it to Christ, but only now have I taken the plunge and commitment to doing so. I want to do so much more for God than I'm doing now--than I was doing then--and a blog is just one way I can honor Him. One very, very small "thank you" for sacrificing His life for me.

I am a Christian, a follower of Christ, and I walk by faith!

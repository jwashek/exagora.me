## Quick Intro
This blog is not about me, I just want to magnify and glorify God for what He has done in my life. But sometimes, the best way to do that is to get personal and tell your own story. That's what this page is all about. This is my story of how God saved me through my faith in Jesus Christ. 

## My Testimony
**The Early Days**<br>
Back when I was in Middle School, I was a very bad kid. Maybe like most kids you might think? Well, most kids don't do drugs before they're a teenager. Most kids don't get kicked out of school for getting in trouble too much. I wasn't most kids. 

**Beginning Thoughts on God**<br>
I grew up Catholic and having knowledge about God. I hadn't really given it too much thought if I'm being honest. I knew about a heaven or a hell, but didn't care. I wasn't a murderer or any of the other obviously evil things out there so I was safe... in my own eyes at least. My dad was different; he was a Christian and always telling me about Christ. *Jesus died for you*, *you can't earn your way into heaven*, and *you need to repent and believe in Him* were all very common things I heard as a pre-teen and teenager. Yeah, okay, Dad. 

I brushed it off and never gave much thought to it. 

* I was a good person
* I believed in God
* I kept some of the 10 Commandments
* I prayed sometimes
* I confessed certain sins to a priest
* I was baptized as a child

The list goes on. Notice the common theme in that list? That short, little one-letter word of `I`. *I did this*; *I don't do that*. It's what most religion requires. A self-righteous effort on behalf of the individual. We rely on ourselves and our own personal effort to save us. Newsflash: we're all human. We **will** make mistakes--and plenty of them. This reason alone is why we cannot rely on ourselves and we must rely on Someone else. That "Someone" being Jesus Christ Himself.

**The Day I'll Never Forget**<br>
If you remember earlier on I mentioned getting kicked out of school? This is really where the story begins.

## Quick Intro
My intent for this blog is to use it to spread the Gospel to those who might never have heard. That is my main focus as a believer. Additionally, I would like to help build up the faith of other believers that may stumble upon this blog. I intend to do that by presenting the Bible to support sound doctrine, expose false doctrine/teachers, and provide a sort of [apologetics](https://bible.org/seriespage/1-what-apologetics) to common hard-to-answer questions about God, faith, and the Bible.

Though, this blog is not about me, I want to use it to magnify and glorify God for what He has done in my life. But sometimes, the best way to do that is to get personal and tell your own story. That's what this page is all about. This is my story--my testimony--of how God saved me through my faith in Jesus Christ. 

## My Testimony
### The Early Days
Back when I was in Middle School, I was a very bad kid. Maybe like most kids you might think? Well, most kids don't do drugs before they're a teenager. Most kids don't get kicked out of school for getting in trouble too much. I wasn't most kids.

### Beginning Thoughts on God
I grew up Catholic and having knowledge about God. I hadn't really given it too much thought if I'm being honest. I knew about heaven and hell but didn't care. I wasn't a murderer or any of the other obviously evil things out there, so I was safe... in my own eyes at least. My dad was different; he was a Christian and always told me about Christ. *Jesus died for you*, *you can't earn your way into heaven*, and *you need to repent and believe in Him*. "Yeah, okay, dad. Thanks for the Bible you bought me years ago that just collects dust on my shelf now!"

I brushed it off and never gave much thought to it because:

* I was a good person
* I believed in God
* I kept (some) of the 10 Commandments
* I prayed (sometimes, albeit repetitiously)
* I confessed (certain) sins to a priest
* I was baptized as a baby

The list goes on. Besides futile attempts to earn my way through works, did you notice the common theme there? That short, little one-letter word of `I`. *I do this*, *I do that*; *I don't do this*, *I don't do that*. It's what most religion requires--a self-righteous effort on behalf of the individual. We rely on ourselves and our own personal effort to save us. The reality, though, is we're all human. We **will** make mistakes--and plenty of them. We will fail. It's in our nature. This reason alone is why we cannot rely on ourselves and we must rely on Someone else. That "Someone" being the Lord Jesus Christ.

### The Day I'll Never Forget
I mentioned getting kicked out of school. That is really where the story begins. After countless detentions, In-School Suspensions, and Out-of-School Suspensions, the School Board decided to kick me out and have me continue the remainder of the year in AEP (Alternative Education Program). AEP was essentially a tiny building next to the school where all the other kids that got kicked out went to finish up the rest of the school year. This was around Springtime of 2006.

One day, I remember finishing up my schoolwork early and having nothing to do. I looked around the room and noticed one thing in common about each person there. They were bad. Some were *very* bad. I remember dwelling in these thoughts before having a moment of introspection: *am I bad too?* It was at this moment that I had deep conviction about my past and present state.

Sometime later, I'm not sure if it was the same day, days later, weeks later--I don't know--I went home and started playing a video game on my PlayStation 2. Out of seemingly nowhere, I got up, turned off my PlayStation 2, picked up the Bible off my shelf that my Dad bought me years ago, blew the dust off like some cliche movie scene, and started reading from Genesis 1:1. I got around halfway through the page before I had another moment of introspection: *what am I doing?!* However, the difference this time didn't bring conviction like before, but an immense joy and reverberating chills throughout my whole body.

I called my dad right away and told him what happened. He prayed with me on the phone and from that day forward, I believed. I **truly** believed. I believed Jesus died, was buried, and rose again, but I believed He did it for *me*! It was a different type of belief; it was not mere head knowledge anymore, but it was literally life-changing and altered my thinking and lifestyle from that day forward. I was saved! (I still *am* saved!)

### The Aftermath
Immediately after I got saved, I remember having no desire for drugs, alcohol, or living the godless and sinful life I used to live. I quit swearing, smoking; I quit watching porn. I had a massive change all around.

> __Note:__ I don't think a changed life is a requirement for salvation. Salvation is simply believing the Gospel and trusting in Christ. However, I do believe a changed life will come through sanctification by way of repentance (change of mind) and genuine faith, but this is not a means of salvation itself--which some preachers errantly teach.

I was telling others about Christ, I was being led by the Spirit, I was praying and studying His Word in a much more meaningful way, and my decisions were placing God above all else. I sure wasn't perfect, and I still am not, but the desire to serve Him was there--and still is. I wanted to do good, I wanted to help others, and I felt like my heart was different. I cared about obeying God, keeping His commandments, and wanting to lead others to Christ; to lead others in this new life that I had tasted that is freely given as a gift to be received for all who call upon Him. 

> <u>Romans 5:18</u> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.

To sum it up, let's go to the Scripture. Because Galatians 2:20 can sum it up better than I ever could:

> <u>Galatians 2:20</u>: I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
  
Christ gave His life for *me*. Christ gave His life for **you**. After believing the Gospel and placing our faith in Jesus Christ, we should want to live our lives for Him as a result of this unspeakable love ([2 Corinthians 9:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209%3A15&version=KJV)). 

### Present Day
All those years ago, I still haven't lost my faith in Jesus, my Savior. But in those years between first getting saved and now, I certainly had my fair share of mishaps in sin, doing things I knew I shouldn't ([Romans 7:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A18-19&version=KJV)), and not devoting nearly as much time reading/studying the Bible that I should have. Just within the past several months (Summer 2022) is when I have deepened my relationship with Jesus to a level of when I first got saved back in the Spring of 2006. And boy is it refreshing! Like I said before, I never lost my faith, but I did lose my zeal over the years. It's something I am striving to claim back.

Even after all those years though, I still get convicted over sin and I honestly thank God for that. It is that conviction that drew me closer to Him then and draws me closer to Him now. It *was* that conviction that led me here right now. I wanted for so long to write a blog and dedicate it to Christ, but only now have I taken the plunge and commitment in doing so. I want to do so much more for God than I'm doing now--than I was doing then--and a blog is just one way I can honor Him. One very, very small "thank you" for sacrificing His life for me.

I am a Christian, a follower of Christ, and I walk by faith!

> <u>2 Corinthians 5:7</u>: For we walk by faith, not by sight
